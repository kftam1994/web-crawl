        "description": "Trendlines\nThe white lines are the markers of order amidst chaos. Solid and dashed, they connect critical highs and lows, serving as pathways that reveal the future of price action. They outline the potential for breakouts or breakdowns\u2014decision points where the market bows to our strategy. \nThese lines carve the battlefield, where traders either rise or fall. These highs and lows are structured almost uniquely, deviating from the conventional setup of ordinary highs and lows.\n\nVolume Weighted Average Price (VWAP)\nThe blue stair-step line is no ordinary indicator\u2014it is the foundation of fair value. This VWAP dynamically calculates the average price weighted by volume, serving as a stronghold for price action. The market respects it as a key support and resistance level. A bounce off this VWAP is a signal of bullish resurgence, while a break below hints at bearish momentum. It\u2019s not just a line\u2014it\u2019s the axis around which the market pivots.\n\nIndicator\nThis is the pinnacle of liquidity visualization. The lines below are not mere decorations\u2014they are the heartbeat of the market:\n\u2022\tOrange (Bitcoin Price): The core driver of the current movement.\n\u2022\tYellow (BTC.D Moving Average): The critical indicator of Bitcoin dominance. When BTC.D rises, Bitcoin often gains strength at the expense of altcoins. When BTC.D falls, altcoin liquidity flows upward.\n\u2022\tBlue (TOTAL3 Moving Average): The maestro of altcoins, showcasing their potential for explosive growth.\nThis tool mirrors liquidity flows, signaling shifts in dominance. As Bitcoin moves downward, we see Bitcoin price rise; when Bitcoin moves upward, Bitcoin price moves downwards. This interplay reveals the unseen mechanics of the market.\n\nVolume Profile (Left Sidebar)\nThe red and green histogram bars are the battlegrounds of buyers and sellers:\n\u2022\tRed bars: High selling activity, barriers the bulls must conquer.\n\u2022\tGreen bars: Strongholds of buying strength, where the bulls rally their forces.\nAs of now, the price dances near high-volume nodes\u2014key zones of contention. Victory lies in breaking free from these areas, unleashing powerful directional moves.\n\nCustom Candles\nThese candles are the secretive arsenal of this strategy, meticulously designed to expose manipulation, price inconsistencies, and pivotal moments in the market. They are crafted to reveal when the market is preparing for massive moves while remaining subtle in their true power. They keep the edge sharp without revealing too much.\n\nAltcoin and Bitcoin Insights\nThis is a live battlefield where updates reign supreme. Altcoins are testing their waters, and Bitcoin pumps are set to reignite soon. I will be providing updates for short trades as manipulation keeps unfolding and inconsistencies present themselves.\n\nNote: The VWAP has been condensed into a 5-day timeframe to align seamlessly with the chart, while the indicator operates on a 1-day timeframe. Additionally, it dynamically reflects insights from the 4-hour timeframe, offering a multi-dimensional view of price action. \n\n(Global liquidity is where prices are headed) \n",

        "description": "We are going to approach XRPUSDT differently. If you read the  Solana trade-idea , you know that we are using a strategy based on accumulation to enter a LONG position. With XRP we are using a different approach and this is because these two charts are quite different. For XRP, we will wait for confirmation. Let me explain.\n\nThe retrace/correction/consolidation period can last for as long as it wants, we have no way to determine when it will be over. Sometimes we go into the chart and start to calculate time predictions based on past action and we feel very confident and the market moves completely different to whatever numbers we came up. That's why we focus on resistance and support rather than specific dates. The levels where a pair will find support or resistance are easy to spot, but it is very hard to predict when exactly the market will move because this happens based on many varied events. It can be the choice of a single entity or a group, it can be a market development, some news event, etc. Information we don't have access to.\n\nWhen will it grow?\nWe can make some approximations.\n\nIs it growing?\nWhen the next move is in and confirmed we can tell with a very high level of accuracy. While we cannot predict exact timing, when it is happening the market gives very strong and clear signals; the point of no return.\n\nThere is a moment when the decision is made and there is no going back. This is how we will approach our next XRPUSDT LONG Leveraged trade. We will wait for market confirmation and profit all the way to the moon.\n\nLeave a comment if you want to know more.\nI'll post an update.\n\nIf you leave a comment and boost I know that you are interested and I can publish many more articles. This is the only feedback I have. (No interactions means no interest \u2014feel free to show your support!)\n\nThank you for reading.\n\nNamaste.",

First, with the recent legal progress Ripple has made, there's a sense of optimism in the market which could drive prices up temporarily. Additionally as the year starts investors may look to cash in on any recent gains or adjust their portfolios creating selling pressure. Plus, market sentiment often shifts around the new year ",

        "description": "BTC/USDT Weekly Outlook\nBased on this chart, Bitcoin is showing a strong uptrend on the weekly chart, currently navigating key levels that could determine its secondary trend before continue the next rally!.\nHere's my technical analysis using trend based fibonacci.\n\nKEY LEVELS TO WATCH\n\nSupport Levels :\n1. $94,800 (0.786 Fib). BTC is sitting near this level, which is acting as a short term support zone. Holding above this level keeps the bullish momentum alive.\n2. $85,000 (0.618 Fib). This is a more significant support level. A drop to this level would still align with a healthy correction within the broader uptrend.\n\nResistance Levels :\n1. $107,000 - 108,000 (1 Fib). The next major resistance BTC needs to break for a continuation of the rally.\n2. $120,000+ (1.272 Fib). This is the first target for a breakout beyond the major resistance, I think this is the base target for Bitcoin on this cycle and might as well the top on this cycle.\n\nIndicators :\n1.Exponential Moving Averages 21&34 showing below the current price on weekly chart indicating a very bullish trend, we could see potential buy when Bitcoin reaching near above the EMA.\n2. Stochastic, shows the Bitcoin is overbought, signaling a potential slowdown or minor pullback in the short term. However, in strong uptrends, overbought conditions can persist for weeks, so this isn't necessarily bearish.\n3. Volume, the trading volume has been steadily increasing, which supports the ongoing uptrend. Watch for higher volume during breakouts to confirm the move.\n\n\nScenarios to Consider :\n1. Bullish Continuation\nIf BTC holds above $94,800 and breaks past $107,000, the next target would be $120,000+ (1.272 Fib). This scenario aligns with the current trend and market strength.\n2. Healthy Pullback\nA dip to $85,000 (0.618 Fib) would still be considered a natural retracement in the bigger picture. Look for buyers to step in at this level to keep the rally alive.\n3. Bearish Reversal\nIf BTC loses the $85,000 support and the moving averages start flattening or turning downward, it could signal a deeper correction or a potential trend reversal, keep an eye for reversal chart pattern and any signs of reversal.\n\nOverall, Bitcoin's bullish structure is intact, with the price consolidating near a critical Fibonacci level. While short term corrections are possible, the bigger picture points toward further upside if key supports hold. A breakout above $107,000 opens the door for a push toward $120,000+, but traders should keep an eye on the $94,000 and $85,000 levels for signs of weakness.",

For me, SMAs are more of a support tool rather than a tool for entries or exits.\n\nIn combination, they are valuable, which is why I use them together for long-term trades.\n\nHere\u2019s an example with NESN:\nThe white fork projected the continuous trend until the market fell below the L-MLH, opened, and closed beneath it. This was a warning signal and a price level where partial profits could have been taken.\n\nThen came the SMA crossover\u2014an exit signal for the entire position. At the same time, you could have reversed the position and entered short, using a tight stop just above the last pivot high.\n\nYou\u2019d then exit at the center line or trail the trade, aiming for the L-MLH as the final long-term target.\n\nKey Takeaways:\n1. The fork provided a warning signal to take partial profits.\n\n2. The SMAs signaled a complete exit and offered an opportunity for a potential short.\n\n3. The center line of the red fork provided another (partial) profit target, as the market reached balance there. It also allowed for trailing the position to maximize profits.\n\n4. The SMAs are keeping us in the short trade.\n\nWhen used correctly, both tools can be very helpful.\n\nLet\u2019s stop the \"wars\" over which indicator, setup, or oscillator is \"better.\"\nInstead, let\u2019s use what works well, enjoy the good results, and take pride in doing a great job.\n\nBy the way - I need your help!\nI\u2019m receiving more and more private messages asking to start a trading group focused on education and crafting trade ideas.\n\nIf you think you\u2019d join, please answer the following questions in the comments below or send me a private message:\n\n1. Do you trade to:\n   a) Build wealth over many years\n   b) Have fun\n   c) Make money consistently to pay for monthly bills\n\n2. Do you feel more comfortable trading with:\n   a) A high win-rate\n   b) A high risk/reward\n\n3. Do you prefer:\n   a) Short-term trades (hours/days)\n   b) Long-term trades (weeks/months)\n   c) Scalping\n\nFeel free to comment on what you\u2019d expect from a trading group and what you want most from trading.\n\nWishing you all happy profits!",

Why? let's explain it!\n\n Engulfing Zones:\n The term \"engulfed\" on this chart represents price levels where strong price movements absorbed opposing orders, marking areas of liquidity shifts.\nThe most recent engulfing level near $93,500 is a critical pivot. It has established itself as a short-term resistance point to watch.\n\n Support Zone:\n The shaded region around $91,000\u2013$92,000 has consistently acted as strong support, with multiple rejections confirming its significance.\nThis zone is crucial for maintaining the current bullish structure.\n\n Resistance Levels:\n First Resistance: $93,500\u2013$95,000, which aligns with prior engulfing price action.\nMajor Resistance: $97,271, marking the upper boundary of the consolidation range and a potential breakout zone.\n\n Trend Structure:\n The chart suggests a building bullish structure, with higher lows forming. This indicates buyers are gradually stepping in at higher price levels.\n\n Potential Breakout Setup:\n The chart projects a bullish breakout above $93,500 and a test of $95,000. A sustained move above $95,000 could pave the way for a rally toward $97,271.\n____________________________________\n\n Scenarios to Watch:\nBullish Scenario:\nA breakout above $93,500 confirms momentum toward $95,000. Clearing this resistance opens the path to $97,271 and possibly higher levels.\nThe continuation of higher lows supports the bullish outlook, provided the price remains above $91,000.",

Some time ago price rebounded from the trend line and dropped to the resistance zone, which coincided with the resistance level. Then price some time traded near this level and then tried to grow, but failed and continued to decline, breaking the 2640 level. Then it fell to the support level, and even a little below, after which some time traded and then broke the 2600 level and started to grow. Firstly Gold rose almost to resistance level, but then made small corrections and then continued to move up. Some time later price rose to the resistance zone and tried to rise to the resistance level, but failed and when it touched the trend line, the price dropped to the support level. After this movement, Gold rebounded and in a short time rose to the trend line and even broke it. At the moment, I expect that XAUUSD will rise to the resistance level and then start to decline to the support level, breaking the trend line again. For this case, I set my goal at 2600 level.

Also, the most  important Resistance for Bitcoin , in my opinion, right now is the  50_SMA(Daily)  and  in the next step $98,100 .\n\nIn addition,  with the closing of the monthly candle , we can also see the  Shooting Star Candlestick Reversal Pattern .\n\n After breaking the Uptrend lines , I expect  Bitcoin  to  fall  at least to the  width of the Ascending Channel(broken)  and  Potential Reversal Zone(PRZ) .\n\n Cumulative Short Liquidation Leverage :  $97,686-$96,380 \n\n Cumulative Long Liquidation Leverage :  $91,446-$90,000 \n\n \u26a0\ufe0fNote: If Bitcoin breaks the Resistance lines and Resistance zone($96,620-$95,500), we can hope for a further increase in Bitcoin.\u26a0\ufe0f\n \n\n \ud83d\ude4fPlease respect each other's ideas and express them politely if you agree or disagree.\ud83d\ude4f \n\nBitcoin Analyze (BTCUSDT), 1-hour time frame\u23f0.\n\n \ud83d\udd14Be sure to follow the updated ideas.\ud83d\udd14 \n\nDo not forget to put Stop loss for your positions (For every position you want to open).\n\nPlease follow your strategy and updates; this is just my Idea, and I will gladly see your ideas in this post.\n\n Please do not forget the \u2705'  like '\u2705 button \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude0a & Share it with your friends; thanks, and Trade safe.",

Now, it's pulling back to retest that consolidation area. The price has been following a downward trendline, and if it rejects that trendline again, we could see a bullish move. On the daily timeframe, the price bounced off the support level, forming a long tail bar, which is a positive sign. I expect the market to retest the middle of the consolidation zone that often acts as support and resistance, followed by continuation upward move.

        "description": "XAU/USD Analysis: Yearly, Monthly, and Daily Timeframes\n\n Gold (XAU/USD) has always been a popular trading instrument, especially for traders looking to hedge against inflation, economic uncertainties, and currency fluctuations. Analyzing the market trends on yearly, monthly, and daily timeframes can provide valuable insights into price movements and trading opportunities. Below, we\u2019ll break down these timeframes to offer a comprehensive perspective on XAU/USD.   FXOPEN:XAUUSD  \n\nYearly Analysis of XAU/USD\n\nOver the years, XAU/USD has shown a consistent uptrend, driven by global economic factors such as inflation, geopolitical tensions, and central bank policies. Gold\u2019s role as a safe-haven asset ensures its demand during times of crisis.\n\nKey Highlights:\n\nHistorical Performance:\n\nIn the last decade, gold has seen significant growth, peaking during economic turmoil like the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.\n\nMajor support levels can be identified around $1,200 - $1,400, while resistance levels lie near $2,000 - $2,100.\n\nInfluential Factors:\n\nInterest rates: Higher rates often reduce gold\u2019s appeal, while lower rates support its rise.\n\nInflation and USD strength: Gold\u2019s inverse correlation with the dollar makes the yearly timeframe critical for observing long-term trends.\n\n2024 Outlook:\n\nWith global uncertainties, including inflationary pressures and geopolitical risks, XAU/USD is expected to remain volatile but could maintain its bullish long-term trajectory if economic conditions weaken.\n\nMonthly Analysis of XAU/USD\n\nThe monthly timeframe helps identify medium-term trends and pivotal areas for traders.\n\nKey Highlights:\n\nTrend Analysis:\n\nGold\u2019s monthly movements often align with seasonal trends, such as increased demand during wedding seasons in major markets like India and China.\n\nBreakouts from consolidation zones on the monthly chart typically signal the start of significant moves.\n\nTechnical Levels:\n\nMoving averages (e.g., 50-MA and 200-MA) on the monthly chart are key indicators of gold\u2019s direction.\n\nFibonacci retracement levels from recent highs and lows offer insight into potential support and resistance zones.\n\nRecent Performance:\n\nIn 2023, XAU/USD fluctuated between $1,800 and $2,100, reflecting investor uncertainty.\n\nDecember 2024\u2019s closing price will likely shape the tone for early 2025.\n\nEvents to Watch:\n\nFederal Reserve meetings: Rate decisions significantly impact gold\u2019s price.\n\nMonthly inflation data and Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) reports.\n\nDaily Analysis of XAU/USD\n\nFor intraday traders, the daily timeframe is crucial for identifying short-term trends and trading opportunities.\n\nKey Highlights:\n\nPrice Action:\n\nDaily movements in XAU/USD are often driven by news events, including economic data releases and geopolitical developments.\n\nCandlestick patterns such as Doji, Hammer, and Engulfing provide immediate insights into market sentiment.\n\nIndicators to Use:\n\nRelative Strength Index (RSI): Helps determine overbought or oversold conditions.\n\nMoving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD): Aids in identifying trend reversals.\n\nBollinger Bands: Indicate periods of low volatility and potential breakouts.\n\nKey Support and Resistance Levels:\n\nCurrent support lies around $1,920, while resistance is seen near $2,000.\n\nBreakouts above or below these levels could define the short-term trend.\n\nRisk Management:\n\nDue to gold\u2019s volatility, proper stop-loss and take-profit strategies are essential.\n\nUse daily pivots and ATR (Average True Range) to gauge potential price ranges.",

In this analysis, I aim to provide you with a comprehensive overview of the future price potential for  Ethereum , \ud83d\udcda\ud83c\udf87\n\nEthereum is considered a stable and secure investment in crypto, thanks to its predictable price movements and lower volatility compared to many altcoins. Its price often mirrors Bitcoin, adding a layer of market stability. As one of the largest cryptocurrencies by market cap, Ethereum attracts significant institutional interest and boasts a rapidly growing network.  \ud83d\udcda\ud83c\udf87Historical returns of at least 26% suggest strong potential, especially as it hasn\u2019t yet reached its all-time high. While Ethereum offers solid growth prospects, investors should set realistic goals, diversify, and regularly assess the market to manage risk and maximize returns. \ud83c\udf87\ud83d\udcda\n\n\ud83e\udde8  Our team's main opinion is:  \ud83e\udde8\nEthereum offers stability, strong growth potential, and institutional interest, with realistic targets and diversification key to optimizing returns.\n\n Give me some energy !! \n\u2728We invest countless hours researching opportunities and crafting valuable ideas.

        "name": "The Moment of Truth - Gala's Bottom Could Be In",
        "description": "We are at a pivotal moment. After reviewing my charts, I want to revisit my previous analysis where I illustrated that Gala is currently in a WXY correction, with the Y wave unfolding. Initially, I expected the Y wave to develop as a Zig-Zag correction, but as time has passed, it appears more like a descending triangle. Whilst a descending triangle is considered bearish, in context to the overall correction it could also be considered a consolidation pattern signaling a pending bullish breakout into Wave 3.\n\nRight now, price action is nearing the apex of the triangle, which means a decisive move\u2014up or down\u2014should occur imminently. For this reason my bias has now changed to neutral and I am looking for a bullish or bearish signal to happen.\n\n Bullish Case \nPrice is currently struggling beneath the 26-day and 50-day EMAs, creating diagonal resistance. For a bullish scenario we are looking for a clear break above these EMAs on the 4-hour chart would provide a reasonable signal that the Y wave is complete and that bullish momentum may be returning.\n\nThat said, a WXY correction is inherently complex and could morph into another X wave followed by additional corrective patterns. In such a scenario, an upward impulse might still emerge, but the structure would need to be reevaluated.\n\n Bearish Case \nOn the downside, price needs to decisively break below $0.03454 to confirm further bearish movement. This level has held as support so far, but the situation remains precarious.\n\n Key points to watch: \n\n \n The 200-day EMA on the daily chart is around $0.0314. A sustained close below this level would be highly bearish and signal deeper corrections ahead.\n A descending triangle, if confirmed, is traditionally a bearish continuation pattern. The measured move from the height of the triangle would target the 0.786 Fibonacci level at $0.02794.\n \n\nAdditionally, order book analysis on Binance reveals significant buy orders clustering around $0.026 and $0.025. While this shows strong demand at lower levels, it also highlights that many market participants are anticipating further downside. This doesn\u2019t guarantee a drop to those levels, but it\u2019s something to keep in mind.\n\n Summary \nAt this point, I\u2019m adopting a neutral bias.\n\n \n A breakout above the triangle and EMAs would prompt me to consider entering the market, as it would signal the completion of the corrective phase.\n Conversely, a breakdown below $0.03454, especially with daily or 4-hour candle closes under the 200-day EMA ($0.0314),** would signal a bearish continuation, and I\u2019d prepare to fill positions near my targets around $0.02794 or lower.\n \n\nIf I had to speculate, I\u2019m leaning toward the possibility of a flash crash. Here\u2019s why:\n\n \n If the price is to break down, I would not want it to stay below $0.0314 for long.\n A candle close below this level on the daily chart, or even prolonged trading under it on the 4-hour, would place price action below the 200-day EMA. This is highly unusual for a bull market and could signal a deeper correction.\n \n\nThat said, markets can surprise, and we\u2019ll likely have clarity within the next 24 hours. Until then, I\u2019m watching closely and staying flexible. Let\u2019s see how this unfolds.",

        "description": "Hello traders, I want share with you my opinion about Bitcoin. By observing the chart, we can see that the price rebounded from the resistance level, which coincided with the seller zone and dropped to the support level, which coincided with the buyer zone. After this, the price rebounded from the 92800 level, rose to the resistance level, and even rose higher, breaking it again. Soon, BTC turned around and in a short time declined to support level, breakingthe  97500 level one more time and then it made impulse up. Price rose higher than the resistance level, but soon turned around and started to decline inside the downward channel, where it broke the 97500 level again and then fell to the channel's support line. Next, the price tired to grow, but failed and continued to decline. Later BTC fell to the support level, and even declined lower, reaching the support line of the channel, after which it started to grow. in a short time, BTC rose to the resistance line of the channel, breaking the 92800 level, but recently it turned around and fell to the support level. Now, I expect that BTC can rise a little more to almost the resistance line of the channel and then fall to the support level. Then price can break this level and continue to decline inside the downward channel. So, I set my TP at 91000 points. Please share this idea with your friends and click Boost \ud83d\ude80",

        "description": "Bitcoin had an impressive rally, reaching $100,000, a milestone I never imagined we'd see in 2024. But not only did we hit $100,000, we soared all the way up to $108,392.28! It truly made my day, and I'm sure many others feel the same. We've all been holding for years, and I've been in cryptocurrency since 2009-2010. To witness Bitcoin hit 100k is nothing short of a miracle, and it's reflected in the charts.\n\nI want to wish everyone a Happy New Year! It's been a fantastic 2024, and this is my final chart of the year. Right now, we're looking at Bitcoin forming a head and shoulders pattern. It's a bit sloppy, but it could work. The left shoulder, head, and right shoulder are clear, and if the price breaks below the neckline, we could see a drop all the way down to $73,607.06.\n\nI hope the TradingView monitors will promote this post and not delete it. What goes up must eventually come down, and it looks like Bitcoin is heading that way. We might return to where we started, possibly all the way down to the rally from November 5th. Let's hope it doesn't go that low and instead halts at the point of interest around $83,000.\n\nWishing you all a wonderful and safe New Year! Thanks to the TradingView monitors for keeping most of my posts up this year only one got deleted. See you all next year! 2025\n\n#BitcoinMilestone #NewYearCrypto ",

Increased funding in connected projects can lead to higher adoption, collaborations, and an eventual demand increase for APT.\n\n\n2. Tomarket Announces Transition From TON to Aptos for Upcoming TOMA Token Release (1 week ago)\n\nImpact on APT: Positive\nA transition from another blockchain (TON) to Aptos suggests trust in Aptos' scalability, speed, or ecosystem. This can attract developers, investors, and users, potentially boosting APT's demand.\n\n\n3. Tomarket Partners with Aptos Foundation to Launch  PSECZ:TOMA  and Build Future Products (2 weeks ago)\n\nImpact on APT: Positive\nPartnership news further establishes Aptos' utility and credibility in the blockchain space. Building products on Aptos could increase network activity and ecosystem growth, positively impacting APT.\n\n\n4. Crypto VC Funding Witnessed a Significant Surge, Avalanche Gains $250M (2 weeks ago)\n\nImpact on APT: Neutral to Slightly Positive\nAlthough this is Avalanche-specific, it shows a general bullish sentiment in the crypto market. VC interest might also spill over to other projects like Aptos if its ecosystem remains active and innovative.\n\n\nOverall Sentiment: The first three news items have a positive tone, which could help in stabilizing or pushing APT's price upward if paired with favorable market conditions.\n\nOne love; Sherry SOC.\n\n",

        "description": "It sounds like you're referring to the potential opportunity to buy Bitcoin (BTC) during a market dip, as fear and uncertainty in the market often drive prices lower. This strategy is commonly known as \"buying the dip.\"\n\nHere are some considerations if you're thinking about this:\n\n1. Market Sentiment\n\nFear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) can create opportunities to buy BTC at a discount. Keep an eye on news, market trends, and sentiment indicators like the Crypto Fear & Greed Index.\n\n\n2. Technical Analysis\n\nLook for support levels or areas where BTC has previously bounced back.\n\nUse tools like RSI (Relative Strength Index) to identify oversold conditions.\n\n\n3. Risk Management\n\nOnly invest what you can afford to lose, as BTC can be highly volatile.\n\nConsider dollar-cost averaging (DCA) to reduce the impact of short-term price fluctuations.\n\n\n4. Cloud Mining or Storage\n\nIf you're referring to cloud services, ensure they're reputable before investing in mining or storage solutions. Many scams exist in this space.\n\n\nWould you like help analyzing current BTC trends or guidance on tools for tracking crypto prices? c\n\n\n",

Let me break down my strategy so you can take full advantage of this move!\n\nMy Strategy:\n\nPattern Identification: We\u2019ve spotted an ascending triangle on the 4-hour chart with a key resistance at $3,472.\nEntry (Buy Limit) $3,472: If the price breaks this resistance with strength, we\u2019ll place a buy order and aim for $3,878.\nRisk Management: To protect ourselves from unexpected reversals, we\u2019ll set a Stop-Loss at $3,095.\n\nKey Confirmation: We\u2019ll only enter if there\u2019s increasing volume to avoid false breakouts.\nWhy This Strategy? An ascending triangle like this often signals a continuation of the bullish trend. With solid risk management, we\u2019re aiming for a strong risk/reward ratio while staying aligned with the market\u2019s momentum.\n\nDisclaimer: This content is for informational and educational purposes only.

As the digital currency climbs in value even during the global pause, it reminds us that the crypto market never sleeps, never takes a break, and always offers opportunities for those paying attention. In a world where traditional assets follow fixed schedules, Bitcoin proves its resilience and constant potential, making it the ultimate representation of a truly decentralized and borderless financial system.",

        "description": "Gold Price Analysis: A Historical Overview and Future Outlook \nGold has always played a crucial role as a safe-haven asset during periods of economic uncertainty. Over the years, its price movements have been shaped by various global events. Let\u2019s take a step-by-step look at the key historical moments and their implications for the future.\n\n [ b]Historical Highlights:- \n\n \n March 2008:  Financial Crisis Escalation\nGold prices surpassed $1,000 per ounce for the first time, driven by the Global Financial Crisis.\n\nKey Factors:\n  - The collapse of Bear Stearns fueled fears of systemic financial instability.\n  - Aggressive Federal Reserve rate cuts weakened the U.S. dollar, increasing gold\u2019s appeal.\n\nImpact: Gold surged as a safe-haven asset during one of the most critical financial crises of the modern era.\n\n October 2008:  Global Financial Crisis Peak\nGold prices dropped to $681 per ounce initially due to forced liquidation but rebounded later, stabilizing around $730-$800 per ounce.\n\nKey Factors:\n  - Forced selling to meet margin calls during the crisis.\n  - Central banks introduced aggressive interventions, including interest rate cuts, to stabilize the economy.\n\nImpact: Despite short-term declines, gold regained its safe-haven status as market uncertainty persisted.\n\nProfits and Losses of New York Stock Exchange Broker-Dealers 2000 to 2008:\n  \n\n Cost of the 2008 Financial Crisis  :\n  \n\n August 2011:  All-Time High Amid Global Economic Uncertainty\nGold reached a record high of $1,917 per ounce amid the U.S and Eurozone debt crisis and concerns about the U.S. economy.\n\nKey Factors:\n  - Investors were concerned about the U.S. economy after the S&P downgrade of U.S. credit from AAA to AA+ earlier in August.\n  - The 2011 U.S. Debt Ceiling Crisis was one of a series of recurrent debates over increasing the total size of the U.S. national debt.\n  - Safe-haven demand surged as central banks maintained low interest rates.\n\nImpact: This period underscored gold's reliability during global economic turmoil.\n\n November 2015:  Multi-Year Low\nGold prices dropped to $1,050 per ounce, the lowest since 2010.\n\nKey Factors:\n  - Expectations of a Federal Reserve rate hike reduced gold\u2019s appeal.\n  - Low inflation diminished its role as a hedge.\n\nImpact: The decline highlighted gold\u2019s sensitivity to monetary policy and inflation expectations.\n\n August 2020:  Record High During COVID-19\nGold hit an all-time high of $2,075 per ounce, driven by the global economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nKey Factors:\n  - Massive monetary and fiscal stimulus from central banks and governments.\n  - Weak U.S. dollar and negative bond yields boosted demand.\n\nImpact: Gold cemented its status as a hedge against both inflation and economic uncertainty.\n\n September 2022:  Aggressive Rate Hikes\nGold dropped to around $1,615 per ounce as the U.S. Federal Reserve aggressively raised interest rates to combat inflation.\n\nKey Factors:\n  - Rising bond yields and a strong U.S. dollar reduced gold\u2019s appeal.\n  - Geopolitical Uncertainty.\n\nmpact: This period reflected the inverse relationship between gold and rising interest rates.\n\n October 2024:  Record Peak\nGold surged to a new all-time high of $2,790 per ounce due to heightened geopolitical tensions and monetary policy shifts.\n\nKey Factors:\n  - Ongoing conflicts in the Middle East and Eastern Europe.\n  - Central banks\u2019 easing policies and inflation fears supported the rally.\n\nImpact: This continued gold\u2019s bullish momentum, driven by its safe-haven demand.\n\n Future Outlook for Gold in 2025 \nKey Expectations:\n1. Bullish Momentum to Continue:\n- Gold is likely to remain on an upward trajectory, potentially breaking the $3,000 per ounce barrier.\n- Geopolitical uncertainty and inflation concerns will continue to drive demand.\n\n2. Consolidation and Corrections:\n- Gold may face short-term corrections, with support levels at $2,600-$2,500, before resuming its bullish trend.\n\n3. Critical Drivers:\n- Geopolitical Tensions: Persistent global conflicts will boost gold\u2019s safe-haven appeal.\n- Monetary Policy: Central bank decisions, especially from the Federal Reserve, will influence gold prices. A pause or reversal in rate hikes will support bullish momentum.\n- Inflation Hedge: Rising inflation expectations will sustain demand for gold as a store of value.\n\n Key Levels to Watch: \n- Resistance Levels: $2,800, $3,000, and beyond.\n- Support Levels: $2,600, $2,500, and $2,300.\n\n Summary: \nGold has consistently demonstrated its value as a safe-haven asset during periods of economic and geopolitical uncertainty. With its recent surge in October 2024 and the ongoing macroeconomic conditions, the outlook for 2025 suggests further bullish potential. However, investors should be prepared for short-term corrections before the continuation of its long-term upward trend.\n\nGold's remarkable performance over various timeframes highlights its strength:\n- In 2024 alone, gold rose by 27.25%, marking a stellar annual performance.\n- Over the past 5 years, gold has gained an impressive 79.25%, showcasing sustained upward momentum.\n- Over the past 10 years, gold has soared by 121.00%, reflecting its resilience and importance as a long-term asset.\n\n Disclaimer: \nThe insights and expectations shared in this analysis are based on my personal experience and deep understanding of the market. While these projections are grounded in my expertise, it is important to exercise caution and perform your own research before making any investment decisions. Remember, the market carries inherent risks, and past performance does not guarantee future results.",

The current chart set up in Daily timeframe looks to me exactly the same as that of ai16z on 27th Dec when the price skyrocketed from $0.90 to the current price of $1.72.   MACD crossed above 0 level and showed green histogram bar, and RSI and Stochastic both crossed and clearly pointed upwards in the bull territory.   That all three momentum indicators show clear bull signal  in Daily chart doesn't happen often.   I invest in this project and do not intend to do short term trading wit this asset.  I think another parabolic leg is coming just like ai16z.  I might take small profit if momentum indicators start to show clear negative divergence in 4H or daily chart, but I intend to hold most of my position until it reaches 1 billion Market cap. ",

However, a pullback may be expected near term given how far this has been sold.\n\nI will short the Pound should the support get broken clearly given this 1.25 level could form triple bottom as per chart. \n\nGood luck and Happy New Year everyone!\nHope this helps and remember not to rush into any position - no FOMO!\n\n",

        "description": "The basis for the analysis in today's idea about the future of the total capitalization of the crypto market is our idea from 2 years ago, where we assumed that the \u201cbottom\u201d has already been reached and that we will continue to see strong growth.  Read it \ud83d\udc47\n  \n\nSince then, the total capitalization of the crypto market has grown 4 times from $800 billion to $3.2 trillion. This is mainly due to the growth of the  CRYPTOCAP:BTC   price from $16k to the current $95k and its BTC.Dominance index from 39% to the current 58%.\nMany altcoins are still depressed, many of them failed to update their ATH, so let's assume that there hasn't been a real altseason yet)\n\n And here's how the capitalization of other financial assets has changed approximately over 2 years: \n                 end of 2022\ud83d\udc49end of 2024\nSP500 - $33 trillion \ud83d\udc49 $45 trillion                    \nGold - $11 trillion\ud83d\udc49 $18 trillion\nSilver - $1 trillion \ud83d\udc49 $1.8 trillion\nCryptocurrencies - $800 billion \ud83d\udc49 $3.2 trillion\nCrypto rules, at least in terms of growth!)\n\nIn addition, two fundamental events have taken place since then: BTC ETFs and ETH ETFs are gateways for the infusion of large institutional money into the crypto market, but also flags for the regulation of the crypto market.\n\n And then, only modeling in the mix with our fantasies and desires for 2025) \n1\ufe0f\u20e3 Previous cycles of rapid growth of the crypto market lasted 550 days after the #Bitcoin halving, so we assume that the current one will last at least until the end of October 2025.\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 The \u201cgrowth power\u201d of the total capitalization of the crypto market decreased by 6 times with each cycle, which means that in the current cycle  it should reach at least $7-8 trillion \n3\ufe0f\u20e3 But this time, we have a \u201cdark horse\u201d - ETFs, and who knows how many more of them will be approved in the future and how this will affect the crypto market. Moreover, the number of cryptocurrencies is no longer thousands or tens of thousands, but millions. Memecoins are created in 30 seconds and rolled out to a multi-million dollar capitalization in weeks) And it is still commonly believed that the \u201cnaive and hungry\u201d retailer with the eternal FOMO syndrome, who buys anything at any price, has not returned to the crypto market.\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 Therefore, purely hypothetically, simply based on fractal analysis and a combination of fibo levels, we assume that the crypto market can  \u201cswing\u201d up to a cosmic $53 trillion \n5\ufe0f\u20e3 Further, according to the same fractal analysis, the current correction of prices on the crypto market and its total capitalization should not be very long, well, at most another -10% from the current $3.2 trillion to $2.85 +|-\n6\ufe0f\u20e3 Everything is very fantastic and promising, doesn't it?) Then let's put the icing on the cake and go to celebrate the New Year 2025.\nAccording to our forecast from 2 years ago, the  OKX:BTCUSDT   price has every chance of reaching  $355,000 by the end of 2025  \ud83d\udc47\n ",

We're seeing the Stochastic oscillator flirting with oversold territory, and anyone who's been in this game knows that's when you want to position yourself. It's not just about timing - it's about recognizing the patterns that repeat themselves.\n\nWhat's really getting my attention is the SQZMOM_LB indicator. Those VIX spikes we're seeing aren't random noise - they're telling us a squeeze is brewing. When this pressure cooker blows, we could see rapid upside movement that'll catch the shorts off guard.\n\nSpeaking of shorts, they've shown their hand at the $60 VWAP level. Both daily and weekly charts confirm this sweet spot, and I'm seeing all the signs of a short sweep setting up. This is exactly the kind of technical confluence that precedes significant moves.\n\nI'm anticipating MSTX to first reclaim the $100 level, with potential to test previous highs around $175-200. The short squeeze, when it triggers, could accelerate this movement significantly. Smart money will be watching these levels closely.\n\nThe key here is patience.\n\n Let the technicals confirm what we're seeing. When that squeeze triggers - and it will - you'll want to be positioned ahead of the crowd. \n\nStay tuned for updates as this play develops.",

        "description": "Now that 2024 has concluded, EUR/USD has ended the year at its lowest point, marking a 7% decline from January and a 9% drop from its summer peak. \nMost notably, the pair fell 6% since November\u2014a significant move for such a typically stable currency pair, highlighting strong bearish momentum.\n\n Technical Analysis \n\nOn the daily chart, the EUR/USD has shown a steady downtrend since its double top in August and September. Every meaningful reversal attempt was met with selling pressure, leading to a quick resumption of the downward trajectory.\n\n\n\nThe long-term (monthly) chart paints an even grimmer picture. The pair has been in a clear downtrend since its 2008 peak of 1.60, and it now sits precariously on critical support levels from the 2015 and 2017 lows.\n\n Fundamental Outlook \n\nThe fundamentals align with the technical bearish trend. Diverging monetary policies and a bleak economic outlook for the EU add to the pair's struggles.\n\n Conclusion: \n\nGiven these conditions, a drop below parity appears likely in the coming year. The most prudent trading strategy for EUR/USD is to sell into rallies and wait for further declines.\n My target is 0.95, but, to be honest, I would not be very surprised by 0.9 \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

This correction activated the 0.5 Fib. retracement level in relation to this 300% bullish growth wave.

We are all adults. Some we win and some we lose. The market decides. We learn from mistakes. We grow and improve from what we learn. Everyday we continue to get better, to become better.

        "description": "The daily chart for Shiba Inu (SHIB) against Tether (USDT) depicts a dynamic and volatile pattern, marked by sharp rises and deep corrections. The chart features key technical indicators and levels that might determine future price actions.\n\nPrice Action and Trend:\nShiba Inu's price action has been highly volatile, showcasing significant swings that reflect its speculative nature and sensitivity to market sentiments. The price currently shows a potential recovery from a downturn, aiming for key resistance levels.\n\nKey Technical Levels:\nResistance Levels (R1 and R2):\nR1: 0.00003239 - Acts as an immediate barrier for any bullish momentum, potentially attracting sellers or profit-taking.\nR2: 0.00004563 - A stronger and more psychologically significant level that could test the bulls' commitment should R1 be decisively broken.\nSupport Levels (S1 and S2):\nS1: 0.00001035 - A crucial level that has historically provided support, suggesting potential buy interest if retested.\nS2: A lower boundary not visible on the current chart but likely significant if the downtrend resumes.\nTechnical Indicators:\nMACD: Currently flat with a minimal gap between the MACD line and the signal line, indicating a lack of strong momentum in either direction.\nRSI: Near the 40 mark, which is slightly below the midpoint, suggesting a slight bearish bias but not yet in the oversold region.\nVolume:\nThe volume appears subdued, consistent with a lack of decisive movement, indicating that traders are possibly waiting for more concrete signals before taking substantial positions.\n\nConclusion and Forecast:\nSHIB/USDT is at a crucial juncture where it could either rebound off the support level at 0.00001035 or face further declines if sentiment worsens. The approach to R1 will be telling; a strong breakout above this level could prompt a move towards R2, while failure to overcome it may result in a retest of S1 or even lower levels.\n\nTrading Strategy:\nBullish Scenario: Look for entry points if SHIB stabilizes or bounces off S1, with R1 as a short-term target. A stop-loss slightly below S1 can limit downside risk.\nBearish Scenario: If SHIB breaks below S1, it may indicate a continuation of the bearish trend, with lower historical supports in focus. Traders might consider short positions on failed attempts to rise above key resistance levels.\nSummary:\nTraders should monitor SHIB/USDT closely for signs of increased trading volume or a breakout from its current levels to gauge the direction of the next significant move. The market's response to these technical thresholds will provide valuable insights into the short-term trajectory of Shiba Inu.",

        "description": "Hi folks today I'm prepared for you Bitcoin analytics. If we look at the chart we can see how the price rebounded from the trend line and rose to the support level, which coincided with the support zone. Then price some time traded below the support level and later finally broke it. After this, BTC rose a little and then made a correction to the support zone, after which it turned around and started to grow to a resistance level. When the price reached the resistance level, which coincided with the resistance zone, it made a correction movement to the support zone, after which at once turned around and started to grow back. Later BTC reached the resistance level and broke it, after which grew to 108400 points and then dropped to the support level, breaking the resistance level. Then BTC some time traded near support level and then rebounded and tried to grow. But recently it fell back to this level, which coincided with the trend line, and continues to trades close. For this reason, I expect that BTCUSDt will make a small movement up. After this, the price turns around and starts to fall, breaking the trend line with the support level, after which make retest, or not and continue to fall. Therefore I set my goal at 88000 points.

We got our bearish target now complete at 2600 followed with the weighted bounce and now heading towards 2629 to complete the Bullish target gap that was left short by a few pips yesterday.\n\nWe are still seeing price play between the two weighted levels and will one of the weighted levels to break and lock to confirm direction for the next range.\n\nWe will keep the above in mind when taking buys from dips. Our updated levels and weighted levels will allow us to track the movement down and then catch bounces up.\n\nWe will continue to buy dips using our support levels taking 30 to 40 pips. As stated before each of our level structures give 20 to 40 pip bounces, which is enough for a nice entry and exit.

        "description": "For years LTC has been bleeding against BTC. It looks like this trend could have finally ended, at least for a short term (possible few months). Very similar to Ethereum vs Bitcoin the chart of LTC silently has changed the trend and is screaming buy. LTC will start to rise in value against BTC and is a very good  trade to gain more bitcoin over a fairly short period of time.\n\nLets take a look at the charts.\n\nOn the left its the 2 week chart of LTC/BTC \nThe price action seems to have found a bottom along with a lot of indicators. Top indicator is the trusty RSI, with a bottoming out and strength has made a significant move up.\n\nThe middle indicator is the RCI3 lines which has just made 2 important crosses with the red and blue lines quietly gaining strength and momentum.\n \nOn the bottom is the BBWP. The main thick line has turned blue, and historically blue is the best buy area for this indicator.\n\nOn the right is the monthly chart with 3 indicators respectively bellow.\nThe first indicator is the RCI3lines for second time. We can see for the last many months it has been flatlining but recently the red line has sliced through the GREEN and is trying to cut through the BLUE (possibly January).\n\nThe Stochastic RSI is showing momentum is coming into this trade, however it has not confirmed yet. The red line would have to cross the 20 level like the blue line for it be official.\n\nOn the very bottom is the ADX and DI. The GREEN line has made an all important cross above the red line which shows a change in the trend. The purple line shows the strength in this trend. The strength a the moment is not strong, however we can see that it also has changed it's direction and looking to start climbing as the move gets stronger.\n\nThe first major target (take profits) for this trade would be at the 5000 sat level. getting above that could lead anywhere from 8000 to 15000 that has a lot of time to play out and still remains to be seen\n\n\n\nThank you for checking my chart. Please like and share with friends.\n\nWeAreSat0shi \n\n\n",

I'm thinking of changing out one more indicator. The solid ones I'm keeping are the SOPR momentum, money flow, aggregate funding rate (AFR), MACD, RSI, hash rate capitulation, Bollinger band trend, Coinbase premium, plus directional movement, and the transaction fee spike indicators.

        "description": "I think there's going to be a major stock market crash now. I drew a Schiff Pitchfork connecting the peak and bottom of the 2008 subprime mortgage crash to the peak of Covid-19. Why? I'm looking at the geometry of how the stock market reacts to large systemic human problems. Notice that SPX is now overbought in exactly the same region as the 2000 dot com bubble crash.\n\nWhat is this thing I'm calling the \"Stock Buyback Crash\"? Well without getting too political, the name of the game in Capitalism in exploitation and grift. You can only pay your employees shit, fire huge percentages of your employees, and buy back your own stock to inflate your stock prices for so long before the game of chicken is up. Corporations haven't been reinvesting their surplus capital into improving their businesses. No, they've been artificially inflating their stock prices to get those sweet executive bonuses. Well, the bubble's about to burst. This whole system is a grift. I can highly recommend reading the book called 'Understanding Capitalism' by Richard Wolff.\n\n",

This level has broken above March's high around $4090, therefore it is no longer valid and must be cleared for ETH to reach a new all time high above the upper channel wedge.\n\nThe current uptrend appears to be losing momentum. For a resumption of the bullish trend, a period of price consolidation near the lower wedge of the current channel, around the $2700 demand zone, may be required to gather momentum.\n\n Conclusion, A retest of the $2700 level may provide a very favorable buying opportunity. \n\n#AhmedMesbah #Ethereum #ETH #ETHUSD #ETHANALYSIS #CRYPTO #CRYPTOCURRENCY #ETHCOIN #SUPPLYANDDEMAND",

        "description": "New rule. Every time a troll says something to me I will post an update reiterating my strategy.\n\nAs I have been saying for the past few months VARA like most assets is rangebound. Alt season, if there is such of a thing hasn't even entered its beginning stages with Bitcoin still dominating market trades. I may have also mentioned this accumulation zone which VARA is still sitting comfortably inside of is in fact also the range VARA is in. Price action will bounce around within this range rejecting off of some levels and breaking through others, ultimately breaking out above the $0.04 order block. This is because that order block consists mostly of whale traders who have absolutely no interest in allowing the price to go up until they are through accumulating. Traders who recognize these patterns can take advantage of the moment. It is true that the price could spike down further, and this would simply feed bargain traders who seek to buy in as close to a penny as possible. If you want to try and time the market more power to you but my approach is the same. Trade the range, average in, and most importantly don't long the top of the range and unless my stop loss is hit don't short the bottom of the range. I am surprised to see how many short contracts that opened up yesterday. I blamed this on year-end loss accumulation for tax purposes. I know a lot of people think I am insane disregarding all FUD regarding unlocks and emissions. My opinion on this is only about 30% of the token supply is locked right now and I believe much of that will become staked holdings. Staking numbers for the VARA network are quite low right now which I think will be resolved once the unlocks occur. Fearful traders believe that every investor or developer who receives their coins is just going to sell at this bottom price. This never happens and instead the opposite often happens. So don't feed into the FUD too deeply, it isn't that serious. VARA is a long-term investment in my opinion and similar to MATIC and any other layer one stakeable coin the rate of return is quite a bit more important than a small market pull back. Regardless, at this point we may have a few months at least before price action is able to absorb the upper order wall but don't forget once it is absorbed it will be quickly flipped to support. Yes, I know it hasn't happened yet but this is how the game is played, trade the range until the range breaks, if the range hasn't broken there is nothing to cry about. We are long at the bottom and short at the top but just be warned that the top of this range is a very low price tag. If you want 30% profit, go ahead but that is not going to be life changing money is it.\n\nI am not a financial advisor. Stay safe my friends.",

The market is currently consolidating, providing an opportunity to take advantage of its sideways movement. It is rolling back towards a resistance zone and an upward trendline. Looking left, we see that the price has bounced off this area twice before, so it could potentially rebound again given the current sideways trend. I expect the price to reject the resistance zone, leading to a decline. My goal is support zone around 1.03800\n\n\n\n Traders, if you liked this idea or if you have your own opinion about it, write in the comments. I will be glad \ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83d\udcbb  ",

        "description": "Greetings mates, Let us deliberate upon the current weekly chart of Tesla. As it stands the price has resolutely positioned itself above a long-standing multi-year resistance level an area that also previously marked the stock's all-time high. In this context the significance of this resistance is magnified considerably. Furthermore, as today coincides with the final trading day of the month a close above this critical level would signify not merely a weekly triumph but a substantial monthly breakout, underscoring the bullish momentum.\n\nFrom a technical perspective-: The price is positioned in close proximity to a significant resistance level suggesting the potential for a rebound either from this point or slightly nearer to the resistance. For any such bounce or reversal it is imperative that individuals adhere to their respective trading setups. Upon confirmation of the rebound the recent high of 488 can be established as the initial target on the charts. Furthermore should the price break above 488 a renewed upward momentum of approximately twenty percent similar to the movement observed following the current breakout can be anticipated. Fibonacci's important levels also sharing the same spot very well.\n\nFollowing it's ascent to an all-time high in 2021 the stock experienced a precipitous decline losing approximately 75% of its value from that peak. However, it has recently managed to surpass that prior high once again. For a detailed analysis of the factors behind this dramatic trajectory I invite you to peruse my previously published insights recently the link to which is provided below.\n\nThanks for reading hope you like this publication.\nHappy new year in advance hope you have wonderful trades in 2025 !\nBest regards- Amit",

It\u2019s tough, but it\u2019s the necessary first step. With little to no understanding of the markets - but you'll believe what you know is everything.\n\n 1\u20133 Years: \nThe Grind and Acceptance \u2013 Real growth begins here. You realize how little you know, start developing strategies, and focus on risk management. Many quit, but the persistent ones build a foundation for success. Those who can't drop their ago, will never breakthrough to profitable trading. Your ego of thinking what you know is what you need and what you don't know is what you don't need will cause your failure - and when you know what you know, but think you don't need what you know - will cause you self-destruct in the markets.\n\n 3\u20135 Years: \nThe Turning Point \u2013 Consistency sets in. You\u2019ve refined your strategies and gained enough knowledge to make steady profits. Full-time trading becomes achievable for the disciplined. Repeatability is the biggest difference maker. Be careful, if your ego spikes, you'll get nowhere.\n\n 5\u20137 Years: \nThe Wealth Builder \u2013 You\u2019re reaping the rewards of compounded knowledge. The ego is gone, replaced by confidence.

Your knowledge, discipline, and experience make you a force in the market. This is where trading becomes second nature, and financial freedom is no longer a dream. Money is no longer exciting. An easy day trade, is a new Ferrari. Your friends with billionaires. Your trading system is a money making machine, and your understanding of the markets is deep to the level of seeing trades just by taking a quick glance at any chart. \n\nYou no longer a work for the market.\n\nThe market works for you.\n\nRemember... \n\nYou don't know, what you don't know.\n\nAnd what you know, is what you don't want to know.\n\nRead that again. \n\nPlan the Trade, Trade the Plan!",

Here\u2019s how you can set signals for the NOTUSD asset based on the provided price levels:\n\n\u2705Buy Signal:\nEntry Point: Consider buying when the price is around 0.0066. This level seems to be a lower support point, offering a potential entry for a bullish move.\n\nConfirmation: Wait for additional confirmation, such as a price rebound or positive volume increase, to ensure the support holds.\n\n\ud83d\udfe2Take Profit Signal:\nFirst Target: Set the first take-profit level at 0.0087. This represents a significant price increase from the entry point.\n\n\ud83d\udfe2Second Target: The next take-profit level could be at 0.01689, which aligns with the higher price range mentioned.\n\n\ud83d\udd34Stop Loss Signal:\nRisk Management: Place a stop-loss order slightly below the entry point, around 0.0054, to minimize potential losses if the price moves against your position.\n\nSell Signal:\n\nExit Point: If the price reaches 0.000505 and shows signs of reversal or resistance, consider selling to lock in profits.\n\nRe-Entry Signal:\n\nPullback Opportunity: If the price retraces to 0.000460 after a peak, it might offer a re-entry point for another potential upward move.\n\nBy setting these price-based signals, you can systematically approach trading the NOTUSD asset, balancing potential profits with risk management.

        "description": "The concept of \"Sovereign AI\" and SMCI building supercomputers in every country worldwide is an ambitious and speculative idea. \n\nInfrastructure Investment\nBuilding supercomputers in every country would require a massive global investment. Supercomputers are extremely expensive to design, build, and install, with costs ranging from $100 million to $300 million per system1. This doesn't include ongoing operational expenses.\n\nEnergy Requirements\nSupercomputers consume enormous amounts of energy. On average, these systems use 6-7 megawatts of power, with peak consumption reaching 9.5 megawatts1. The annual energy cost for a single supercomputer can be approximately $6-$7 million1. Implementing such systems globally would require significant upgrades to power grids and energy infrastructure.\n\nTotal Cost of Ownership\nThe total cost of ownership for supercomputers goes beyond the initial investment. When factoring in electricity, labor, and facilities, the cost per core-hour can reach $0.12 to $0.15, assuming 100% utilization. \n\nFor a global initiative, these costs would be multiplied across numerous countries.\n\nEconomic Impact\nThe global supercomputer market is expected to grow significantly, with estimates suggesting it will reach $27.17 billion by 2034, growing at a CAGR of 11.2%. A worldwide \"Sovereign AI\" initiative could potentially accelerate this growth.\n\nChallenges\nImplementing supercomputers globally faces several challenges:\nHigh operating costs: The substantial energy consumption and maintenance requirements pose significant ongoing expenses.\nTechnical expertise: Managing and optimizing supercomputers requires specialized skills, which may be scarce in some countries.\nEnvironmental concerns: The massive energy requirements raise environmental issues that would need to be addressed.\n\nPotential Benefits\nDespite the challenges, a global supercomputer network could offer benefits such as:\n\nAdvanced research capabilities: \nCountries could enhance their scientific research in fields like climate science, genetics, and materials science.\n\nEconomic development: \nAccess to supercomputing power could drive innovation and economic growth across various sectors.\n\nData sovereignty: Countries could maintain control over their data and AI development, aligning with the concept of \"Sovereign AI\".\n\nWhile the idea of SMCI building supercomputers in every country is speculative, sure, but as Elon said, AI will be just like a utility comany and will required AI centers globally. The global investment in AI infrastructure is indeed substantial. Goldman Sachs estimates that around $1 trillion will be spent over the next few years on data centers, semiconductors, and grid upgrades related to AI development. This gives an indication of the scale of investment required for a global supercomputing initiative. SMCI is at the forefront of the AI implementation. Learn about  the new partnerships being formed with NVDA. Meanwhile you should be counting the sales SMCI has been making. Tripple capacity and demand for the next decaded.",

ATAUSDT has shown  significant volume increase , and the price has risen rapidly. Despite this, I have no intention of chasing it at these levels. Staying disciplined and waiting for meaningful setups is always preferable to impulsive entries.\n\n Key Points: \n \n Volume Surge:  Exceptional increase in trading volume highlights strong activity.\n Rapid Price Movement:  Current price levels are overextended after a sharp rise.\n Risk Management:  Avoid chasing; wait for retracement or a better setup.\n Confirmation Indicators:  I will use CDV, liquidity heatmaps, volume profiles, volume footprints, and upward market structure breaks on lower time frames for validation.\n \n\n Learn With Me:  If you want to master how to use  CDV, liquidity heatmaps, volume profiles, and volume footprints  to identify precise demand zones, just DM me.

        "description": "Yello, Paradisers! #ZILUSDT is sitting at a crucial inflection point. The market is testing a strong support zone that could either trigger a significant rally or lead to a steep drop. Are we about to witness a breakout or a breakdown? Let\u2019s dive into the details.  \n\n\ud83d\udc8e#Zilliqa is currently approaching a key support level around $0.01788, a zone that has consistently acted as a springboard for bullish momentum in the past. This level has been tested previously, showing signs of strength. However, if the support fails to hold, it could spark a cascade of selling pressure, potentially dragging the price down to the next lower Demand at $0.01600.  \n\n\ud83d\udc8eFor now, all eyes should remain on the current support zone at $0.01788. A decisive bounce from here, coupled with increased volume, could signal the start of a rally targeting resistance levels and beyond. Conversely, a failure to hold this zone would confirm a bearish breakdown, inviting further downside movement.  \n\n\ud83d\udc8eThe RSI is hovering near oversold levels but hasn\u2019t yet shown a clear signal for a reversal, leaving ZIL in a precarious position.  This is a critical juncture, Paradisers. The next move could set the tone for #ZILUSDT in the coming weeks. Whether the market breaks out or collapses, remember to wait for confirmation before taking action.  \n\nDiscipline and patience are the foundation of successful trading. Focus on preserving capital and only act on high-probability setups.  \n\nMyCryptoParadise\niFeel the success\ud83c\udf34\n",

        "description": "Coinbase (COIN) has gone a long way since our September 09 buy signal (see chart below):\n\n  \n\nEven though it marginally missed the $360 Target, the pattern served in an excellent way those investors who bought at the bottom of its dominant 2-year Channel Up. The September - December Bullish Leg was by a narrow margin, the shortest (+141.45%) of Coinbase's total 5 major rallies within this pattern.\n\nAs the price is yet again approaching the 1W MA50 (blue trend-line), it is gradually turning into a Buy opportunity again. Even though the shortest Bearish Leg has been -38.74% and that currently places the projected bottom level a little over $215, the 1W RSI has already broken below its MA (yellow trend-line), which has been the ultimate buy signal on all previous technical corrections with the exception of last April.\n\nAs a result, there are more probabilities to see COIN resume the 2-year bullish trend, with the Risk/ Reward Ratio (RRR) turning favorable again. A Dollar-cost-averaging strategy is also suited for those seeking less risk.\n\nOur Target from now on is $500, which represents a +141.45% rise (as mentioned above, the shortest within the Channel Up).\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n ** Please LIKE \ud83d\udc4d, FOLLOW \u2705, SHARE \ud83d\ude4c and COMMENT \u270d if you enjoy this idea!

It\u2019s at this level we wanted to take out our longs and attempt the short trade sticking with the bias of the week which was the 2660 bearish below level.  \n\nIt was a ranging week with minimal movement considering recent weeks, however, we managed to get the resistance level and then the move down on the red boxes where we suggested traders take partials and then leave runners at BE into the close.  \n\nAnother decent week on the markets in Camelot not only on Gold but the other pairs we trade and analyse.\n\nSo, what can we expect in the week ahead?\n\nWell, we again have that order region of 2630-35 which we ideally would like to see visited one more time, however, there is a key level of resistance sitting at the 2625-7 region which we would price to attempt during the early session before settling again.  Ideally, we would like to see one of these levels reject giving a further move downside into the lower support levels which are active on the red boxes.  The first level being 2610 and below that 2600-4 which will need to break for us to go lower into the new year!  \n\nIt\u2019s a really important week with the yearly candle close above the 2655 level to confirm further movement upside.  \n\nThe key levels for the end of year, support 2596, needs to break and close below in order to form the structure to go lower and break the range.  Resistance 2640 needs to break upside and hold in order to see more gains on this precious metal.\n\nSimple one this week as we\u2019re still on our festive break and spending limited time on the charts.  We\u2019ll update and post the analysis for the wider community as we go through the week.

        "description": "\n\n\n\nHere's the details of my potential trade Short on BTC....\n\nDaily Chart:\n- Head and Shoulders Pattern\n- Break and weak retest of 50 day moving average\n\n4hr Chart:\n- Death Cross 50 MA over 200 MA (first time since Sep 4, 2024)\n\nRecent Developments & News\n- See my SPX Idea, the S&P has both a Rising Wedge and Head and Shoulders, making the overall market susceptible to a short term bear move which will be a headwind for BTC given its correlation to the market\n- USA Strategic Bitcoin Reserve has made a lot of headlines and driven increased excitement about Bitcoin.  However, recent comments suggest this will not be a quick decision and is not something that is relevant in the immediate term...\n- In terms of the legal issues around holding bitcoin, \"that's the kind of thing for Congress to consider, but we are not looking for a law change at the Fed,\" Powell said.\n- Given the likely ways such a reserve could be created, \"we suspect such a plan would face stiff resistance from the Fed,\" Barclays analysts said\n- The European Central Bank\u2019s chief bank supervisor, Claudia Buch, on Tuesday also flagged up risks in the crypto market, including \"excessive leverage, transparency (and) conflict of interest\", adding she was keeping a close eye on banks' exposure to that type of assets.\n- In Europe, a series of central bankers this week dismissed any suggestion of bitcoin becoming a reserve asset.\n- Belgium\u2019s central bank governor Pierre Wunsch saw little \"appetite for having reserves in bitcoins\" in an interview on Wednesday. \n- Outside the euro zone, Hungary\u2019s governor-designate Mihaly Varga said on Monday cryptocurrencies were just too volatile.\n- \"We are following the discussion, especially in the U.S. post-elections, closely,\" ECB policymaker Olli Rehn said on Tuesday. \"But our view has not changed. Cryptos are assets, but they are not currency,\" the Finnish central bank governor added.\n\nNote: \nTrump plans to appoint former PayPal executive David Sacks to the newly-created position of White House AI and Crypto Czar, and pro-crypto consultant Paul Atkins to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission.  That said, the discussion and possible policy changes are possible, just not immediate.\n\nIn addition, Michael Saylor has made a lot of news with recent Bitcoin purchases and the potential for issuing shares at MicroStrategy to fund additional BTC purchases.  If the shares issuance is approved it could trigger a wave of bullish activity, however the actions and purchases being taken are in consideration of a long term view for BTC and therefore may have less impact on the short term pattern.  Noted in Risks below.\n\nTarget:\n- Head 108k\n- Neckline 92k\n- Target Move: 16k\n- Target Price: $76k-$80k (13-15%)\n- Stop: A break above  GETTEX:92K \n- The Head and Shoulders Pattern has taken ~41 days to form\n- The expected timeframe is 1/3 the days to formation so ~13-15 days to target\n\nRisks:\n- Bitcoin is currently in a long term cup and handle pattern with a target of $123k, therefore this suggested price action is considered short term and to have risks of the pattern failing\n- Bitcoin has made a very strong move over the past 4 months, therefore it easily can continue it's upwards momentum\n- Approval of MSTR share issuance could trigger a wave of bullishness in Bitcoin, breaking the pattern\n- Trump Inauguration Jan 20th could spark a wave of bullishness as anticipation for new policy takes hold\n\nOverall:\nBitcoin is currently in a long term, very bullish cup and handle pattern with a target of $123k.  Therefore, I'm not in any rush to take a short position in BTC given it's very bullish trends and volatility.  However, the head and shoulders pattern formed with resistance at the long term upward trendline paired with short term weakness in the broader market makes it a strong case for a short term downward movement.  The risk/reward ratio makes it a viable trading opportunity.  See below the details of my trade consideration...\n\nCurrently no position, however, preparing for position if....\n- BTC breaks below the neckline 92,000\n- Retest and fail of the neckline at 92,000\n- Broader market decline, particularly S&P Head and Shoulders pattern breakdown\n\nPlanned position in IBIT\n5 Put Options\n$52 Strike, Estimated price at entry near $52-$53\nExpiration Friday Jan 25th\nTarget average price is $2.00 a contract\nInvestment $1000\nTarget Asset Price $44-$45\nTime of Trade: up to 15 days\nTarget Option Price $8-$10 (6-8:1 Profit Loss Ratio)\nStop $1.00\nPotential Loss -$500\nPotential Gain $3000-$4000",

The chart provided a clear view of potential price movements under various scenarios. Yellow trends indicated sideways movement, green trends represented bullish behavior, and red trends highlighted bearish trends. Based on the chart for 1-Jan-2025, the actual price action unfolded as expected, staying within the highlighted zones and offering valuable insights for traders.\n\n Trading Plan for 2-Jan-2025 \n\n Gap-Up Opening (100+ points) \n\n    If Nifty opens with a gap-up above 23,837 (No Trade Zone's upper band), observe the first 15-minute candle for confirmation.\n  If the price sustains above 23,837, expect a bullish trend targeting the Resistance Zone at 23,998 and further towards 24,068 for profit booking.\n  Place a stop loss just below 23,837 to manage risk and protect capital.\n  If the price fails to sustain above 23,837, expect a potential pullback towards the No Trade Zone. Monitor closely for any reversals within the zone.\n  Avoid taking positions inside the No Trade Zone unless a clear breakout or breakdown is visible.\n \n\n Flat Opening \n\n    If Nifty opens flat near 23,758 (current market price), observe the price action for the first 15 minutes.\n  A breakout above 23,837 indicates bullish momentum towards 23,998 and 24,068, following the same plan as the gap-up scenario.\n  A breakdown below 23,699 (No Trade Zone's lower band) may signal a bearish move towards the Opening Support Zone at 23,617\u201323,640 and further towards 23,537.\n  Place a stop loss just above the breakdown or breakout levels to manage risk.\n  Wait for a confirmation candle (closing basis) before entering trades to avoid false signals.\n \n\n Gap-Down Opening (100+ points) \n\n    If Nifty opens with a gap-down below 23,699, observe the first 15-minute candle for confirmation.\n  If the price sustains below 23,699, expect a bearish continuation targeting the Opening Support Zone at 23,617\u201323,640 and further towards the critical support at 23,537 (reversal zone).\n  Place a stop loss above 23,699 to manage risk.\n  If the price fails to sustain below 23,699, anticipate a pullback towards 23,837 and monitor for potential reversals in this region.\n  Avoid taking impulsive trades at open; let the levels guide your entries and exits.\n \n\n Risk Management Tips for Options Trading \n\n    Always use stop losses to minimize potential losses.\n  Avoid over-leveraging; trade within your capital limits and risk tolerance.\n  Monitor implied volatility and time decay when trading options.\n  Diversify your trades to reduce exposure to single-direction risks.\n  Stick to your plan and avoid emotional decisions.\n \n\n Summary and Conclusion \n\nThe trading plan for 2-Jan-2025 revolves around identifying key levels and understanding price behavior under various opening scenarios (Gap Up, Flat, or Gap Down). The No Trade Zone highlights areas to avoid unless clear trends are visible. Follow the highlighted trends: yellow for sideways, green for bullish, and red for bearish movements. By employing proper risk management and adhering to this plan, traders can make informed decisions and navigate market conditions effectively.\n\n Disclaimer : I am not a SEBI-registered analyst.

        "description": "The daily chart of Fantom (FTM) against Tether (USDT) showcases a volatile trading pattern marked by significant peaks and sharp declines, reflecting typical behavior in a high volatility asset. The chart captures a potential reversal zone as the price approaches a critical support level.\n\nPrice Action and Trend:\nFantom's price has been on a downward trajectory after reaching a peak, indicative of a bearish trend. However, the current stabilization near a support level suggests that the market is considering a potential reversal or further consolidation.\n\nKey Technical Levels:\nResistance Levels (R1 and R2):\nR1: $1.2218 - A near-term resistance level that could act as a target in a bullish reversal scenario.\nR2: Represents a long-term bullish target that could be tested if a significant upward momentum is established.\nSupport Levels (S1, S2, and S3):\nS1: $0.6875 - The price is currently testing this support, indicating a pivotal point for traders to watch.\nS2: $0.5220 - A breach below S1 could lead to price action targeting this lower support.\nS3: $0.2537 - Represents a critical lower boundary that may come into play if the downward trend accelerates.\nTechnical Indicators:\nMACD: The MACD line is below the signal line and negative, suggesting bearish momentum. The increasing distance from the signal line may imply strengthening of this bearish trend.\nRSI: The RSI is nearing the oversold territory, which might indicate that the asset is becoming undervalued, potentially leading to a buying pressure increase.\nVolume:\nRecent volume patterns show spikes corresponding to price declines, indicating that sell-offs are accompanied by higher trading volumes, thus confirming the bearish trend.\n\nConclusion and Forecast:\nThe current positioning of Fantom near support levels with oversold RSI conditions suggests the market is at a decision point. It can either bounce back as a correction from the oversold conditions or continue to decline if the support levels fail to hold.\n\nTrading Strategy:\nBullish Scenario: A rebound from the current or the $0.5220 support level, targeting resistance at $1.2218. Confirmation of a trend reversal would be critical before taking a long position.\nBearish Scenario: Continued bearish pressure pushing the price below current support, targeting $0.5220 and potentially $0.2537.\nSummary:\nFTM/USDT presents a critical juncture where its response to the current support levels could determine the direction for the coming weeks. Traders should closely monitor these levels and adjust their strategies based on confirmed price actions and volume signals.",

        "description": "#BTC (Daily Chart)\n\nThe cryptocurrency market capitalization has dropped by 2.5% over the past 24 hours, while #BTC dominance fell by 0.47%. Despite the bullish momentum, there is a growing likelihood of Bitcoin dropping to the $90,000 zone or lower.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s upward movement was halted by intensified selling pressure near $95,000. Buyers failed to hold the $94,500 level, resulting in a price decline to around $91,600.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Bitcoin\u2019s price on the daily timeframe is approaching the lower Bollinger Band, which is positioned above the seller liquidity zone.\n\nIn the short term, another attempt to test the $96,000 level is likely. However, it\u2019s more probable that a new wave of decline will follow, targeting $90,500. This would trigger stop-losses for long positions (SSL) and push the price to a local low in the $89,000\u2013$90,000 range.\n\nFrom this point, a local upward trend could resume, targeting $96,963, where buyers\u2019 stop-losses (BSL) are located. If this condition is met, Bitcoin could rally to $104,000.\n\nThat said, it\u2019s too early to make global bullish predictions. Bitcoin first needs to clear key levels and stop-loss zones at $90,500 (the nearest realistic target) and $88,722.",

Significant Gains and Potential Consolidation:\n- Past Performance: Investors who bought XRP at $0.50 have experienced substantial gains, potentially exceeding 400%.\n- Current Market Dynamics: The current price action appears to be consolidating, suggesting a potential period of sideways movement before a significant trend emerges.\n- Price Targets: Reaching price targets like $5 or $0.90 in the near term may be challenging due to this consolidation phase and potential market volatility.\n\n2.) Technical Analysis and Entry Points:\n- Short-Term Correction: The current vertical price trend may be unsustainable, and a short-term pullback could be expected.\n- Long-Term Perspective: For long-term investors, the current price level might not be the most attractive entry point. The $1 range could offer a more favorable entry opportunity, depending on market conditions.\n\n3.) On-Chain Analysis and Market Sentiment:\n- Accumulation Phase: The accumulation phase appears to have ended around 12/11/2024, suggesting a shift in market dynamics.\n- Distribution Phase: While not yet confirmed, the market may be transitioning into a distribution phase, where holders are potentially selling their positions.\n- Amazon Partnership: The potential impact of the Amazon-XRP partnership remains a significant bullish factor, but its actual influence on XRP's price is yet to be determined.\n\n\ud83c\udf0eGlobal Market Sentiment\u2b05\ufe0f\n1.)

Let\u2019s dive into the latest analysis to help you prepare for what\u2019s coming.\n\n\ud83d\udc8eGALAUSDT has been consolidating in a descending channel, signaling a healthy retracement. This structure increases the probability of a bullish reversal\u2014if key conditions are met.\n\n\ud83d\udc8eIf the price triggers an inducement and begins forming bullish patterns\u2014such as a bullish I-CHoCH, W pattern, or inverse head-and-shoulders\u2014at the key support zone, the likelihood of a strong upward move will significantly increase. \n\n\ud83d\udc8eIn the case of deeper retracement, we\u2019ll look for a bounce off the strong support zone. However, confirmation is key. Keep an eye on patterns like the bullish I-CHoCH, W formation, or inverse head-and-shoulders to validate the bullish case.\n\n\ud83d\udc8eIf GALAUSDT breaks down and closes a candle below the strong support zone, the bullish outlook will be invalidated. In this scenario, patience will be critical\u2014it\u2019s better to wait for more favorable price action to form before making a move.\n\n\ud83d\udc8eDiscipline and risk management are essential in navigating markets like this. Remember, Paradisers, trading isn\u2019t about predicting\u2014it\u2019s about reacting smartly to what the market shows us.\n\n\ud83c\udf96Play it smart, stay patient, and wait for the best opportunities.

        "description": "$KEKIUS Rockets 160% Amidst Market Downturn\nIn an extraordinary turn of events, $KEKIUS, an Ethereum-based memecoin, has defied the general crypto market dip with an impressive 160% surge. This meteoric rise underscores the unique appeal of $KEKIUS, bolstered by strong technical patterns and compelling fundamentals.\n\nTechnical Analysis\nThe recent $KEKIUS rally is supported by robust technical indicators. The token\u2019s price action exhibited a bullish symmetrical triangle pattern, breaking above this triangle\u2019s resistance and signaling the likelihood of a continued uptrend. Preceding the surge, $KEKIUS formed a \"three white crows\" candlestick pattern, indicating strong bullish sentiment. A notable thrust in trading volume has further validated the breakout, with the token demonstrating strong momentum. However, caution is advised as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently sits at 87.53, indicating overbought conditions. A short-term correction may be imminent before the next leg up.\n\nThe $KEKIUS Phenomenon\n1. Market Capitalization:\n   With a market cap exceeding $295 million, $KEKIUS has achieved this feat without major exchange listings, apart from BingX. This speaks volumes about its community-driven strength and viral appeal.\n\n2. Elon Musk\u2019s Endorsement:\n   A key driver of $KEKIUS\u2019s popularity is its association with Elon Musk. The billionaire\u2019s interaction with the token\u2019s memes, alongside Pepe Official\u2019s response, has solidified its status as a rare and coveted asset in the meme coin space.\n\n3. Community Resilience:\n   Originally created by a developer with rug-pull intentions, the $KEKIUS community reclaimed the project, transforming it into a beacon of decentralized ownership and solidarity.\n\nTrading Activity and Market Metrics\n- All-Time High: $0.3014 (January 1, 2025)\n- Current Price: Approximately 4.3% below the ATH\n- All-Time Low: $0.0006923 (December 17, 2024)\n- 24-Hour Trading Volume: $163 million, a 142% increase from the previous day\n\nThese metrics underscore the heightened market activity and investor interest in $KEKIUS.\n\nRisks and Opportunities\n- Opportunities:\n  - With its breakout above the symmetrical triangle and strong community backing, $KEKIUS shows potential for further gains.\n  - The absence of listings on major exchanges presents an untapped growth avenue.\n\n- Risks:\n  - The overbought RSI suggests a potential short-term pullback.\n  - As a memecoin, $KEKIUS is inherently volatile and influenced by speculative trading.\n\nWhat Lies Ahead for $KEKIUS?\nThe $KEKIUS roadmap is community-driven, with aspirations of reaching new heights. Its alignment with meme culture and Elon Musk\u2019s interactions have created a strong foundation for viral growth. The project\u2019s commitment to transparency and community engagement further sets it apart in the crowded crypto landscape.\n\nConclusion\n$KEKIUS\u2019s recent performance is a testament to the power of community and the enduring appeal of memes in the digital age. While the technical and fundamental aspects point to continued bullish momentum, traders should exercise caution given the potential for short-term corrections. Whether $KEKIUS reaches the moon remains to be seen, but it has undeniably carved a unique niche in the crypto world.",

        "description": "Happy New Year, Traders!\n\nI hope your New Year's celebrations are going well. Here\u2019s a quick update on USDT Dominance (USDT.D) to help you better understand the market.\n\nUSDT.D has rebounded as expected, so it seems that avoiding futures trading and shifting from BTC and other altcoins to USDT was the better choice.\n\nCurrently, USDT.D is at 4.32%, with a strong resistance level between 4.8% and 5%. To create a rejection, it needs to maintain candle closures below these levels, which would eventually lead to a rebound in BTC and other altcoins.\n\nHowever, if USDT.D surpasses this resistance, it could create a stressful situation in the market. On the other hand, a rejection of USDT.D at these levels would bring relief to the market.\n\nLet\u2019s see how the New Year begins. Feel free to let me know if you\u2019d like updates on specific altcoins.\n\nThank you, and trade safely!",

The precious metal is poised to close the year with an impressive 27% gain, marking its best annual performance since 2010. This surge has been fueled by central bank purchases, escalating geopolitical tensions, and monetary easing measures by major central banks.\n\nGold held its ground as markets absorbed signals of a hawkish Federal Reserve (Fed). Strong labor market data and stubborn inflation have led the Fed to project fewer rate cuts for 2025. This expectation contributed to a modest decline in Gold prices during the fourth quarter.\n\n \u2b50\ufe0fPersonal comments NOVA: \nGold moves around the 2600 price zone, ending the year here and the downtrend is dominant\n\n \u2b50\ufe0fSET UP GOLD PRICE: \n\n \ud83d\udd25SELL GOLD zone: $2617 - $2619 SL $2624\nTP1: $2610\nTP2: $2600\nTP3: $2590 \n\n\n \ud83d\udd25BUY GOLD zone: $2584 - $2586 SL $2579\nTP1: $2590\nTP2: $2600\nTP3: $2608\n \n\n \u2b50\ufe0fTechnical analysis: \nBased on technical indicators EMA 34, EMA89 and support resistance areas to set up a reasonable SELL order.\n\n \u2b50\ufe0fNOTE: \nNote: Nova wishes traders to manage their capital well\n- take the number of lots that match your capital\n- Takeprofit equal to 4-6% of capital account\n- Stoplose equal to 2-3% of capital account",

        "name": "Exchange ERASED the trade and Kevin lost $16 billion",
        "description": "The Tragic Story of Kevin, His exchange ERASED the trade and lost $16 billion\n\nKevin Day, a tech geek from Nebraska, loved video games and the internet. In the 1990s, he worked as a video game developer. After his startup failed during the Dot-Com Crash, he started hosting websites. This led him to discover Bitcoin, which he loved for its web freedom.\n\nKevin joined the #Bitcoin  world when the price was $7. He was amazed as it had risen from $0.30. Eager to be part of this new digital money, he spent a lot of time mining Bitcoin.\n\nOn June 19, 2011, Kevin\u2019s life changed forever. Bitcoin's price crashed from $17 to $0.01 in just 20 minutes. While most people panicked, Kevin saw a chance. He decided to buy $3,000 worth of Bitcoin at the incredibly low price of $0.0101. His order went through, and he bought 259,684 Bitcoins for under $3,000.\n\nThe price bounced back quickly, and Kevin's investment turned into $5 million. But his happiness didn\u2019t last. The crash happened because someone hacked Mt. Gox, the exchange where Kevin bought his Bitcoins. The hacker stole coins and sold them, causing the price to drop. Mt. Gox decided to cancel all trades made during the crash, including Kevin's.\n\nKevin had managed to withdraw 643 Bitcoins before the rollback, the maximum allowed by Mt. Gox. But he lost the rest \u2013 259,360 Bitcoins. This was a huge loss, worth about $16 billion today. Kevin learned a hard lesson: never leave your coins on an exchange.\n\nWhat is a Crypto Wallet?\nKevin\u2019s story highlights the importance of understanding and using a crypto wallet. A cryptocurrency wallet is a digital tool that allows you to store, send, and receive crypto securely. It doesn't store the actual crypto but the private keys needed to access the crypto assets on the blockchain.\n\nHow Does a Cryptocurrency Wallet Work?\n1. Public and Private Keys: Each wallet has a public key (like an account number) and a private key (like a password). The public key is used to receive funds, and the private key is used to access and manage them.\n2. Types of Wallets:\n- Hot Wallets: Connected to the internet (e.g., mobile, web, and desktop wallets). They are convenient but less secure.\n- Cold Wallets: Offline storage (e.g., hardware and paper wallets). They are more secure but less convenient for frequent transactions.\n3. Transactions: When you send crypto, the wallet uses your private key to sign the transaction, ensuring it is authorized and secure.\n4. Security: Keeping your private key secure is crucial. If someone gains access to your private key, they can control your crypto.\nWhy Use a Cryptocurrency Wallet?\n- Control: Unlike exchanges, a wallet gives you full control over your private keys and, therefore, your funds. This means you're not relying on a third party's security measures.\n- Security: Wallets, especially cold wallets, provide a high level of security. They're not connected to the internet, making them less vulnerable to hacks.\n- Privacy: Wallets offer more privacy since you don\u2019t have to provide personal information as you would with exchanges.\n- Backup: Most wallets allow you to create a backup phrase or seed phrase. If you lose access to your wallet, this phrase can help you recover your funds.\n\nChoosing the Right Wallet\n- Hot Wallets: Suitable for everyday transactions and frequent access. Examples include mobile wallets like Trust Wallet and desktop wallets like Electrum.\n- Cold Wallets: Ideal for long-term storage. Examples include hardware wallets like Ledger and Trezor, and paper wallets.\n- Multi-Signature Wallets: These wallets require multiple keys to authorize a transaction, providing an extra layer of security. They are often used for business purposes.\nBest Practices for Wallet Security\n1. Backup Your Wallet: Always create a backup of your wallet and store the backup phrase securely.\n2. Use Strong Passwords: Protect your wallet with a strong, unique password.\n3. Enable Two-Factor Authentication: If your wallet supports it, enable two-factor authentication for added security.\n4. Keep Software Updated: Ensure your wallet software is always up to date to protect against vulnerabilities.\n5.Beware of Phishing Scams: Be cautious of phishing attempts. Always verify the authenticity of websites and applications.\nKevin\u2019s tragic loss serves as a powerful reminder: always store your crypto in a secure wallet, not on an exchange. This way, you have full control and protection over your digital assets. Understanding and properly using a crypto wallet is crucial for anyone involved in the crypto world. #CryptoConcept",

        "description": "Just thought I would post this slightly contrarian view. The 0.382 retracement of what I think is wave 3 of 3 is around $85K and this is where many analysts are expecting price to go. To be fair to them, this would be the normal pullback target. However, two things go against this argument. First, wave 4 of an impulse does not usually fall below the wave 4 of the previous move; this would be around $90.7K. BTC has already fallen far into this range and price action looks like we could be in a Wyckoff re-accumulation. The head and shoulders looms threateningly but I feel like it is probably a bear trap. The second reason is that BTC is crawling along the bottom of a rising channel that it has been near the top of since 2011 and it's move to the bottom of the channel began in June 2019. A significant dip would push it below the channel and signal a dramatic change in price action for BTC that I personally feel would invalidate the bull market case for 2025",

        "description": "Hey Realistic Traders,  Is  FX:GBPUSD  Downtrend Here to Say?  Let's dive in \n\nOn the H4 timeframe, GBP/USD has consistently traded below the EMA-200 line, facing multiple rejections at this key level. We observed more than three attempts where the price tried to breach the EMA-200 but failed, reinforcing the continuation of the downtrend.\n\nAdding to this bearish outlook, a breakout from a rising wedge and symmetrical pattern has occurred, both of which typically  signal strong bearish momentum.  Furthermore, the MACD indicator has formed a bearish crossover, providing additional confirmation of GBP/USD's downward trajectory.\n\nGiven these strong technical signals, I foresee a downward movement toward the target at Target 1.23640.\n\n However, this bearish outlook hinges on the price maintaining below the critical stop-loss level at 1.26070. \n\n Support the channel by engaging with the content, using the rocket button, and sharing your opinions in the comments below. \n\n \"Disclaimer: \"Please note that this analysis is solely for educational purposes and should not be considered a recommendation to take a long or short position on GBPUSD\".",

This represents a 10% price increase since last week and  22% price increase since last month\nMusk's tweet offering 1 million Dogecoin to anyone who could prove ownership of an emerald mine has led to gains of 4.9% and who can forget when he changed the Twitter logo to feature the Shiba Inu dog, which caused another 30% pump \n\nwhile Dogecoin's technical structure is bullish, there is a lack of buying pressure behind the coin. traders should be cautious and consider waiting for a break in structure on lower timeframes before seeking to enter short positions. daily active addresses have increased as social media buzzed about Dogecoin, but the 90-day mean coin age has been sliding downward since mid-March.\n\nDogecoin bounced off the moving averages on April 12, as seen from the long tail on the day\u2019s candlestick. The bulls tried to drive the DOGE/USDT pair above the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of $0.09 but the bears did not budge. This suggests that the sentiment remains negative and traders are selling on rallies. Buyers must push and sustain the price above $0.09 to indicate that the selling pressure may be reduced. The pair may then ascend to the 61.8% retracement level of $0.10. Usually, a break and close above this level results in a 100% retracement. If that happens, the pair may soar to $0.11.\n\n",

        "name": "\"FTM eyes a rebound with Sonic conversion and airdrop catalysts!",
        "description": " Fantom (FTM) shows a recent downtrend, but the upcoming Sonic (S) conversion and the associated incentives like the free swaps and airdrop could catalyze significant price action. Here\u2019s a detailed analysis:\n\n Current Technical Overview:\n1. Price Action:\n   - The price is currently trading at $0.74250, down significantly from its recent highs, but it appears to be nearing a support level.\n   - Historically, these levels may attract buyers looking for value or anticipating upcoming events.\n\n2. Moving Averages:\n   - The yellow line represents the 50-day moving average (MA), while the red line is the 200-day MA.\n   - The price is below both MAs, suggesting bearish momentum in the short term. However, a catalyst like the Sonic conversion could reverse this trend if it sparks significant buying activity.\n\n3. RSI (Relative Strength Index):\n   - The RSI is near 38.93, which is close to the oversold region (below 30).\n   - This indicates potential for a rebound, especially with the upcoming news providing a fundamental driver.\n\n4. Volume:\n   - There is moderate volume, but it hasn't yet shown the surge that might accompany the January 19 event. If trading activity picks up in anticipation, this could signal increased interest.\n\n Impact of Upcoming Events:\n1. Sonic (S) Conversion:\n   - The free swaps for the first 90 days provide a strong incentive for current holders to stay invested and for new investors to join.\n   - This could reduce selling pressure on FTM while potentially driving demand.\n\n2. Airdrop*:\n   - A points-based airdrop with 6% of the supply set aside can encourage accumulation of FTM to qualify, likely increasing buying pressure over the coming months.\n\n3. Psychological and Market Sentiment:\n   - Such large-scale events often generate positive sentiment and FOMO (Fear of Missing Out), potentially pushing the price upwards as we approach the event.\n\nStrategy and Outlook:\n1.Short-Term:\n   - As the January 19 date approaches, there is a strong possibility of a price rebound if volume picks up and sentiment turns bullish.\n   - Traders may look for entries near the current support level with tight stop-losses in case of further downside.\n\n2. Mid-Term:\n   - The incentives from the free swaps and airdrop could sustain higher interest in FTM through Q1 2025.\n   - Monitor for a breakout above the 50-day MA as a confirmation of trend reversal.\n\n3. Risks:\n   - If the broader market remains bearish or if the events fail to meet expectations, the price could consolidate or continue its downtrend.\n   - Keep an eye on the volume and RSI for early signals of a move.\n\nKey Levels to Watch:\n- Support: $0.70 (current zone) and $0.60 (major support).\n- Resistance: $0.95 (50-day MA) and $1.20 (recent high).\n\nWith the January 19 event on the horizon, this could be a pivotal moment for Fantom's price action. It's a good opportunity to prepare for potential volatility and capitalize on positive momentum.",

        "description": "Hello, dear friends!\n\nAs the year comes to a close, USD/JPY has shown significant movement, reversing course and dropping below the 157.00 mark. This late-year shift comes as market participants prepare for midweek closures and reduced activity around the New Year holiday. Despite lighter trading volumes, price action remains dynamic, signaling potential shifts in the trend.\n\nTechnically, USD/JPY has failed to maintain its position within the parallel ascending channel, suggesting the emergence of a new trend. A key level to watch now is the immediate support at 156.03. The critical question is whether this support will hold and for how long. Looking at the bigger picture, sustained consolidation below the broken channel could lead to a move toward lower targets, as indicated on the 4-hour chart.\n\nIf you find this idea insightful, don\u2019t forget to leave your thoughts in the comments below and share it with your network. Your support gives me immense motivation to continue sharing valuable experiences and strategies in the forex market. Let's conquer this journey together!",

        "description": "In the ever-volatile world of trading, confidence is a trader\u2019s most valuable asset. However, confidence isn\u2019t about bravado; it\u2019s built on understanding the market\u2019s broader narrative, recognizing manipulation, and adhering to a disciplined plan. Ill try to explore the keys to confident trading by leveraging higher timeframes, understanding candlestick patterns, and exploiting market inefficiencies.\n\n The Importance of Higher Timeframe Narrative \nOne of the most fundamental aspects of confident trading is aligning your trades with the direction indicated by higher timeframes\u2014daily, weekly, and monthly charts. These timeframes provide a macro perspective of the market\u2019s overall trend, filtering out the noise of intraday price action, which is often volatile and misleading.\n\nIntraday moves, while tempting, can cause traders to act impulsively. Without the context of the broader trend, these short-term fluctuations frequently result in losses. By staying aligned with higher timeframes, traders can avoid these pitfalls and make informed decisions rooted in the market\u2019s overarching direction.\n\n Candle Formation and Market Manipulation \nBeyond signaling potential price movements, candles formation reveal how markets manipulate traders. A common manipulation tactic involves candles opening with a move against the overall trend, inducing traders to take positions on the wrong side before the market reverses direction.\n\nFor example, monthly candles often open with an initial move that creates a false sense of direction. During the first week or two, the price may appear bearish, enticing traders to short the market. However, this move typically serves as an accumulation phase for long positions, setting the stage for a strong upward move that forms the candle\u2019s wick. I saw so often when M candle open and in next week form manipulation like crazy bullish or crazy bearish direction! but at the end of month we close candle absolutely in another direction)\n\nIdentifying and Exploiting Market Inefficiencies\nSuccessful traders know how to identify and leverage market inefficiencies. These include concepts such as:\n\nFair Value Gaps: Price imbalances that often get filled, presenting potential trade opportunities.\n\nOrder Blocks: Zones where significant buying or selling activity occurred, marking areas of interest for future price action.\n\nLiquidity Runs: Movements designed to trigger stop-losses or lure traders into positions, creating opportunities for savvy traders.\n\nThese inefficiencies often reveal the footprints of \u201cSmart Money,\u201d the institutional players whose actions drive the market. By understanding these concepts, traders can anticipate high-probability setups and align their strategies with the broader market narrative.\n\n Discipline Through a Defined Trading Plan \nConfidence in trading isn\u2019t just about market knowledge; it\u2019s about discipline. A well-defined trading plan grounded in a higher timeframe bias is essential for consistent success. This plan should guide every decision, ensuring that intraday fluctuations don\u2019t provoke emotional or impulsive trades.\n\nTraders must resist the urge to deviate from their plan unless new information invalidates their higher timeframe analysis. By sticking to their strategy, traders build confidence and consistency in their approach.\n\nThe \u201cJudas Swing\u201d and Smart Money Footprints\nA recurring theme in market manipulation is the \u201cJudas Swing,\u201d an initial move against the trend designed to mislead traders. Recognizing these swings can save traders from falling into traps set by \u201cSmart Money.\u201d\n\nInstitutional players often position themselves within the wicks of candles, accumulating or distributing positions before driving the market in their desired direction. By identifying these footprints, traders can align their actions with the market\u2019s true intent rather than its deceptive moves\n\nMastering the art of confident trading requires more than technical analysis or market knowledge. It demands a disciplined approach rooted in higher timeframe narratives, an understanding of market manipulation, and the ability to exploit inefficiencies. By following a well-defined trading plan and aligning with the broader market direction, traders can increase their chances of long-term success.\n\nRemember, confidence in trading isn\u2019t about always being right. It\u2019s about having a plan, sticking to it, and learning from the market\u2019s movements. By adopting these principles, you can trade with clarity, precision, and resilience in the face of market volatility.\n\nHope you enjoyed the content I created, You can support with your likes and comments this idea so more people can watch!\n\n\u2705Disclaimer: Please be aware of the risks involved in trading.

        "description": "This chart displays the price movement of CRV/USDT on a 9-day candlestick chart. \nThe chart illustrates a significant accumulation phase followed by a sharp price rise, with an emphasis on the liquidity levels at key points.\n\nThe initial drop in price leads into a period of consolidation, marked by an \"Accumulation\" phase.\nAfter the accumulation phase, we observe a surge in price, targeting the \"Buyside Liquidity\" area.\nThe price is currently at a lower level, indicating potential opportunities or challenges in the price movement based on liquidity zones.\nThe liquidity zones, particularly the \"Buyside Liquidity\" marked on the chart, could play an important role in price dynamics moving forward.\nThe chart suggests that future price movements may depend heavily on the dynamics of the liquidity zones and the market's ability to maintain higher price levels after the recent surge.",

        "description": "The daily chart of Avalanche (AVAX) against Tether (USDT) presents a complex wave pattern, indicative of the typical volatility seen in cryptocurrency markets. The chart highlights potential recovery zones and resistance barriers that may influence future price movements.\n\nPrice Action and Trend:\nAVAX has shown a series of peaks and troughs, forming a zigzag pattern that reflects fluctuating investor sentiment and market conditions. Currently, the price is hovering near a support level, suggesting a potential area for reversal or stabilization.\n\nKey Technical Levels:\nResistance Levels (R1 and R2):\nR1: $43.43 - This near-term resistance might act as a barrier to upward movements and a target for short-term bullish sentiment.\nR2: $56.20 - A breach of R1 may open the path to R2, suggesting stronger bullish momentum if achieved.\nSupport Levels (S1 and S2):\nS1: $31.22 - Current levels are testing this support, crucial for maintaining the current trading range.\nS2: $20.30 - A significant drop below S1 could see prices test this lower support, indicating a more substantial bearish outlook.\nTechnical Indicators:\nMACD: The MACD is currently below zero, which denotes bearish momentum. However, the narrowing MACD histogram suggests decreasing bearish intensity.\nRSI: The RSI is around the midpoint, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions. This can suggest a period of consolidation or indecision in the market.\nVolume:\nTrading volume appears moderate, without significant spikes, implying a lack of strong conviction in recent price movements, which aligns with the current consolidation phase.\n\nConclusion and Forecast:\nAVAX's position near the support at $31.22 is critical. A hold above this level might suggest the potential for a rebound towards $43.43, particularly if supported by an increase in trading volume and bullish signals from technical indicators. Conversely, a break below this support may lead to a further slide towards $20.30.\n\nTrading Strategy:\nBullish Scenario: Watch for stability or a bounce off the $31.22 support level, with a potential target at $43.43, followed by $56.20 if upward momentum strengthens.\nBearish Scenario: If AVAX breaks below $31.22, consider a bearish outlook with a next possible stop at the $20.30 support zone. This scenario would necessitate close monitoring of further bearish indicators and increased sell-side volume.\nSummary:\nThe current technical setup for AVAX/USDT suggests a critical juncture; the asset's response to its immediate support level at $31.22 could dictate the trend for the near term. Traders should use a combination of volume analysis and other technical indicators to refine their strategies as the situation develops.",

        "description": "Monday Alpha Report\n2025 01 01\n\nHappy New Year to you all! 2024 was an unmitigated year of prosperity and profit for our community, and it will only get better in 2025. \n\nExecutive Summary:\n-Altcoins continue to outperform Bitcoin. While not giving full credence to the idea of alt season, it is slowly beginning to materialize as key metrics evolve.\n-High probability of Bitcoin rallying into Trump\u2019s inauguration; however, caution is still warranted as downside risks are still strong.\n-Ethereum is likely to continue to underperform Bitcoin in 2025.\n-AI Agents continue to explode, and you should be allocated.\n\nMacro:\nStablecoin Dominance\n  \n\n6.00% still stands as resistance, keeping this metric from pushing us into bearish territory. The bulls do not want this metric in an uptrend, and as the 30 MA creeps closer to the 50 MA, we need to be vigilant for a breakout on this metric to confirm a breakout to test the 200 SMA. For now, the market is indecisive.\n\nStablecoin + Bitcoin Dominance\n  \n\nThis metric wants to continue the bearish trend, which would bode well for altcoin positions. A resumed downtrend in this metric will correlate to rising altcoin prices, so altcoins, for now, are still a better play than Bitcoin. \n\nAltcoin Price Performance vs. Bitcoin\n  \n\nDaily momentum returns to the upside, signaling a potential breakout on this metric after putting in a Higher Low. A pushback up to re-test the long-term downtrend resistance will mean a return to the froth of the altcoin markets.\n\nBitcoin\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price is consolidating, with the Daily Timeframe showing a potential reversal. \n\nTrends: \n  \n5M: Bullish\n30M: Bullish\n1H: Neutral\n4H: Bearish\n\nPrice must close a 4H candle above $95,000 to strengthen the reversal narrative. That close would also confirm the potential Adam & Eve reversal pattern in the same timeframe. Volatility has dropped significantly on the Daily and 4H time frame, and price has found support at $93,000. \n\nKey Levels: \n  \nPOC: $93,727\nVWAP: $93,676\nValue Area High: $94,337 - $94,700\nValue Area Low: $93,730 - $92,851\n\nStrategy:\n\nWhen Bitcoin is in a strong uptrend, it closes its Weekly and Monthly Candles very close to their highs. When Bitcoin\u2019s strength wanes, it begins closing much lower than its highs, as seen in the last two weekly and December\u2019s monthly candles. \n\nIn other words, when Bitcoin is no longer strongly uptrending, as it is now, it tends to pump during the beginning of the month and sell off into the later half of the month. This aligns perfectly with the upcoming catalyst of Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration as the 47th President of the United States. Anticipating a \u201cbuy the rumor, sell the news\u201d type situation, with a potential bull trap emerging in the latter half of this month.\n\nWhile downside risks are still very evident, given that we are trading below the 4H Moving Averages, the Daily Timeframe shows momentum returning to the upside following a bounce off the 60 DMA. \n\nShould the current reversal play out, I expect price to make a run to $100,000 over the next two weeks and potentially higher. We should be cautious of a bull trap at that time.\n\nRisk-hungry traders could begin starting a position with invalidation below $93,000 or wait for a 4H close above $95,000 and 4H momentum to be regained.\n\nAltcoins:\n\nI see altcoins performing well also over the next two weeks, likely front-running Trump\u2019s inauguration same as Bitcoin. Again, downside risk is real, but we saw some strong buybacks today. \n\nXRP - Target of $2.70.\nENA - Target of $1.20.\nHBAR - Target of $0.35.\nFTM - Target of $0.96.\n\nAgain, I\u2019m cautiously optimistic. I cycled about 30% of my portfolio into altcoins today, 20% into AI Agents (Zerebro, SPORE, Pillzumi, Nothing, YNE, SEN), and the rest into Bitcoin. We\u2019re probably bottomed out for now, but I will cut Bitcoin and alts fast if we start heading for the lows again. We will hold AI Agents until we lose momentum, but that\u2019s the meta play for this year.\n",

Yes we are getting up here but doesn't mean we can't go higher yet and looking at my TA in addition to other stocks they all look bottomed out and ready for a move higher to keep the bull trend in tack.

The hourly moving average of gold is still dead cross downward short divergence, so the short position of gold has not ended. Gold is just rebounding now. Yesterday, the rebound of gold in the US market was under pressure at 2622 and continued to fall and then hit a new low. The short-term rebound of gold in the intraday was suppressed near 2610. We pay attention to the short-term suppression of 2610-2612 above, and there is still room for shorts below.\n\nFrom the 4-hour analysis, gold will focus on the 2610-2612 first-line short-term suppression in the short term. If the rebound touches this position, you can enter a short-selling order. Focus on the 2635-40 first-line suppression situation. The lower part will focus on the 2596-2600 first-line short-term support. In operation, use the rebound to short. Mainly, be cautious in pursuing orders in the middle position and wait patiently for key points to enter the market.\n\nGold operation strategy:\n1.

Short-term selling opportunities (short positions) on similar assets may be attractive.\n\n---\n\n#### \ud83d\udcc9 Overbought and Oversold Conditions (Based on RSI and Stochastic Indicators)  \n- **RSI Indicator:** The RSI value of 33.34 suggests the market is nearing the oversold zone.  \n- **Stochastic Indicator:** K-line at 24.50 and D-line at 22.57 indicate the market is already in the oversold zone.  \n\n\ud83d\udd0d **Analysis:** This situation shows strong selling pressure, but a potential price reversal or short-term correction could occur soon. Cautious traders may wait for clear reversal signals.\n\n---\n\n#### \ud83d\udcc8 Moving Averages Analysis (EMA and SMA)  \n- **Short-term Averages (10-Day):** EMA at 0.6866 and SMA at 0.6819 are above the closing price of 0.6775, indicating bearish momentum.  \n- **Long-term Averages (50- and 200-Day):** Both EMA50 and EMA200 are also above the current price, reinforcing the bearish market sentiment.  \n\n\ud83d\udd0d **Analysis:** The downward movement relative to all moving averages across timeframes provides a strong sell signal. Traders may capitalize on this situation by selling or entering short positions.\n\n---\n\n#### \ud83d\udd0d Key Indicator Analysis (MACD, CCI, and Momentum)  \n- **MACD Indicator:** The MACD value is -0.024, with the signal line at -0.025. The MACD line is below the signal line but close to a bullish crossover.  \n- **CCI Indicator:** The CCI20 value of -82.30 indicates an oversold condition.  \n- **Momentum Indicator:** The Momentum value of -0.029 confirms declining price strength.  \n\n\ud83d\udd0d **Analysis:** These indicators continue to signal selling pressure, though there is a slight possibility of a minor reversal in the short term.\n\n---\n\n#### \ud83d\uded1 Key Support and Resistance Levels  \n- **Support Levels:**  \n  - First support level: 0.6830 (based on classic pivots).  \n  - Second support level: 0.5832 (based on classic pivots).  \n\n- **Resistance Levels:**  \n  - First resistance level: 0.8686 (based on classic pivots).  \n  - Second resistance level: 0.9684 (based on classic pivots).  \n\n\ud83d\udd0d **Analysis:** Traders may use the support level at 0.6830 as an entry point for short-term buying, while the resistance level at 0.8686 could serve as a take-profit target.\n\n---\n\n#### \u2705 Summary and Recommendations  \n\ud83d\udcc9 **Recommendation:** The market is currently in a strong bearish phase. Traders can adopt short-term selling strategies and cautiously buy near identified support levels.  \n\ud83d\udca1 If the price approaches the 0.6830 support level and is accompanied by reversal signals (e.g., rising RSI or positive MACD), a good buying opportunity may arise.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f **Disclaimer:** This analysis is AI-generated and should be combined with personal knowledge and experience.

        "description": "Hello, this is Greedy All-Day.\nToday\u2019s analysis focuses on AMD (Advanced Micro Devices).\n\nWeekly Chart Analysis\n\n\n\nLooking at AMD's weekly chart, the stock has followed a historical long-term trendline since the 1970s. Over the years, there have been four major trendline breaks, each followed by substantial corrections:\n\n87%, 75%, 93%, and 54% corrections from the trendline break points, with an average correction of approximately 77%.\nImportantly, these corrections are measured from the trendline break, not the stock's all-time high.\nRecently, AMD has broken below its long-term trendline again.\nThis suggests we should be prepared for the possibility of a 77% correction from this point.\n\nWhere Would a 77% Correction Lead?\n\n\n\nA 77% correction from the trendline break would bring AMD to approximately $35.\n\nThe $35 Zone: Why It\u2019s Significant\n\n\n\nThe $35 level is particularly noteworthy because:\n\nIt aligns with the green box zone, which acted as a resistance area before AMD\u2019s breakout to all-time highs in 2018\u20132019.\nIt coincides with a retest zone in the white box, where historical support was tested.\nIt also matches historical resistance dating back to the 2000s, making it a logical retest zone.\nIf AMD were to rebound, $35 would be a strong candidate for a turnaround point.\n\nBearish Indicators\n\n\n\nSeveral factors point to a continued bearish trend:\n\nAMD appears to have completed a symmetrical triangle pattern with a downside breakout.\nIt has broken below the August 5, 2024 weekly low, a key support level.\nThe only remaining support is at $116.37, marked by the green box.\nIf $116.37 breaks, and the pattern turns out to be a descending triangle, the target could exceed 85%, reaching levels even lower than $35.\nCurrently, AMD is trading within the white box supply zone.\n\nA break below $116.37 opens the door to $93, the lower boundary of the white box.\nHowever, if AMD moves like it did in the red box supply zone in the past, we could see an expanded downward pattern.\nHistorically, AMD has experienced declines of up to 67% from its highs, which supports the possibility of further downside.\n\nWhen to Buy?\n\n\n\nBased on AMD\u2019s historical behavior:\n\nOptimal Buy Zone:\n\nIf AMD drops approximately 70%, reaching $35, it could represent a long-term investment opportunity.\nThis level aligns with key historical support zones and could serve as an excellent entry for investors looking to capitalize on AMD's growth potential.\n\nConservative Buy Levels for Upside Momentum:\n\nFirst Entry: When AMD breaks above the weekly 20 EMA, currently at $140.35.\nThis level is still far from the current price.\nSecond Entry: Upon a breakout above the yellow box supply zone, which marks the upper boundary of the descending triangle pattern.\nWhile the pattern and resistance trendline are broken, overhead supply zones remain significant obstacles.\nThird Entry: If the purple box (Ichimoku Cloud) on the weekly chart provides support, this could also indicate a potential entry point.\n\nConclusion\n\nAMD is a unique stock that may not be well-suited for gradual accumulation due to its high volatility and tendency for deep corrections.\n\nWhile it has been a market leader during bullish periods, the stock\u2019s history shows frequent, severe pullbacks of 70% or more. This makes timing critical for successful trades.\n\nBearish Outlook: The current trend is downward, and there\u2019s potential for the stock to drop further, possibly to the $35 zone.\nBullish Outlook: For buyers, $35 could represent a once-in-a-decade opportunity to accumulate shares if AMD\u2019s long-term growth narrative remains intact. Alternatively, entering on clear breakout levels with a cautious approach is advised.\nInvestors must remain patient and disciplined, waiting for either a deep correction or a confirmed trend reversal. Only then can AMD offer the high reward-to-risk opportunities it\u2019s historically known for.\n\nLet\u2019s stay sharp and trade wisely. \ud83d\ude80",

        "name": "World War III 2025-2027 | prophecies of Greek saints of our time",
        "description": "I decided to make this post and include some of the prophecies of Greek saints of our time, regarding the upcoming events and the 3rd world war. I think it is the right time. I will quote some of what was said about how we will understand that we are close to the 3rd world war. \n\nInterpretation of the Holy Revelation according to the Holy Bible and the Holy Fathers\u201d, is revealing as one point states that \u201cthe Third World War will be the places where the Euphrates River originates and flows, that is, Turkey, Asia Minor, Syria, Iraq, perhaps even Iran\u2026\u201d\n\n1.  Metropolitan Antonios of Sisani and Siatist  was born in 1920 - Died: December 17, 2005\n\n    \u2022 the world war 3 will start from Syria and if it starts from there, Greece and the whole world will eventually starve.\n      \n The war in Syria began in 2011 but Assad fell in 2024. in summary proceedings, within a week. Coincidence? This is a trap for Turkey, I will explain why below.\nAnd as Trump said Appearing to allude to Turkey's Ottoman past, which included control over modern day Syria, Trump added: \"They've wanted it for thousands of years, and he got it, and those people that went in are controlled by Turkey, and that's OK.\" Trump Says \u201cVery Smart\u201d Erdogan Behind the Fall of Assad in Syria  \n\n and this is the big trap for Erdogan, the great leader(fox) \n\n2.  Saints Paisios  July 25, 1924,- Died: July 12, 1994 (age 69years)\n\n    \u2022 Turkey is like a fox. It always does tricks\u2026A monk from Mount Athos conveyed to us the following words of Elder Paisios: Turkey is like a fox... always cunning. When it realizes that a trap has been set to catch it, it begins to jump with all four legs, and thus it is caught with all four. This is what Turkey will suffer.\n\n This thing particularly impressed me. because as President Trump says Turkey holds the key to Syria's future.. But this is precisely the trap that Saint Paisios said, because Turkey is against the Kurdish state, we are talking about 40 million people, but Israel and America want and support the Kurds. \n\nSo we will finally have a war between Israel and Turkey and that's how they will overthrow Erdogan.\n\n This reasoning that I accept is from  Metropolitan Fr. Neophytos of Morphou  \n (born 21 January 1962 as Omiros Masouras) is a Greek Cypriot clergyman of the Eastern Orthodox Church and bishop of the autocephalous Church of Cyprus.  \n\n3.  Elder Theodore Agiofarangitis of Crete  Died:(28-4-2016)\n      \n     \u2022 The blessed ascetic Elder Theodore Agiofarangitis of Crete ) \n      had said to Metropolitan Fr. Neophytos of Morphou: \u201cMy children, you will drink your coffee and you will hear that the Jews have hit the nuclear program of Persia! (Iran) Then the great events will begin! And at the same time, or a little earlier, Erdogan will fall\u201d! \n\n So when Erdogan fall we said how, The new government will be pro-Western and very anti-Russian, then we will have a war between Russia and Turkey, how? The new Turkish government will cause incidents on Greek islands, one of which will be Cyprus, and in the Aegean, then Russia will attack Turkey within 10 days in most of its cities.\n\nThese are the first and the second  halves of WW3 \n\nback to  Saints Paisios  July 25, 1924,- Died: July 12, 1994 (age 69years)\n\n    \u2022  Palestine is a field, the Dead Sea is a grave\u201d - The prophecy of Saint Paisios about Israel and the role of Russia \n      \n    \u2022 The great war (WW3) will be fought in 2 halves.\n      \n    \u2022  The first half will be in the Middle East and they will make Palestine a stadium, that is, they will level it. (The Jews are already bombing Gaza, we see it every day) *stadium because there are no buildings due to the bombings\n      \n    \u2022  And he also says something else that is difficult to interpret , first they will make Palestine a stadium and then the Dead Sea will become their grave. \n\n    \u2022 In the second half, the Bosphorus Straits will groan\u2026 And the second half, which will be the most tragic for all of humanity, no matter how joyful it is for us Greeks, will take place in Constantinople (Istanbul), in the Bosphorus Straits the straits will groan\u2026 The time will come when Russia, so outraged by the then Turkish policy, will strike Turkey in all directions because it will close the straits.  Not Erdogan, his successors\u2026\u2026. \n \n\n   \u2022Also,  Saint Paisios   said that \u201cGod will save everyone from this war to return \tdefeated. The Greek army will be a spectator. No one will return victorious. The field will be Palestine, the grave the Dead Sea. This will be the first half, but there will also be a second half. (Perhaps with these prophetic words Elder Paisios wants to tell us that World War III will begin in the parts of Syria and \tPalestine and then will expand to Asia Minor and Constantinople). After these events, man will reach a dead end and then everyone will ask to learn about the Gospel and the Scriptures. Christ will have pity on the world and show a sign so \tthat they may believe. Then one will look to find an unbeliever.\u201d \n\n4.  Elder Theophylact  saw in a vision a huge blood-stained sword and when he asked: -My Christ, where will this blood come from? -from Syria \n\n5.  Saint John the Theologian  Died: 99 AD \nAmerica, the great Babylon - 2000 years ago Saint John the Theologian prophesied it - you will pay the greatest price with submersion and drowning from your shores that will be caused by modern weapons that the Russians call Poseidon and Satan that will raise waves of enormous height that will hit like tsunamis on the coasts of the USA. \n\n There is a pun in Greek about America. America will remain partial. \n      \u2022\"i Ameriki tha meinei meriki\" \n\n6. Elder Ephraim of Arizona  Died:December 7, 2019 (age 91years),Florence, Arizona, United States saw this. It will happen around the time that the great war between the West and Russia in the Bosporus Straits will be in progress. Then it will be heard that a terrible geophysical phenomenon has occurred in America. \n\n Everyone believes in the climate crisis. So stupid, but the revelation says that in the last years forests will burn and cities will flood. We saw what happened in Hawaii and California, what happened in Greece, what happened in Valencia, Vienna, etc., and how many more will come. We will see geophysical phenomena everywhere, in all nations, in all cities will see earthquakes,  floods, flood etc and if you wonder why because for our unrepentant sins\u2026 especially, magic - abortions - unnatural intercourse \n\n7.  Saint Aristocles  the Russian said it in 1918, \"Oh America, you will feed the whole world and you will go hungry.\"\n\nIf you ask me\u2026 2025-2027 I have 4 points of interest that will guide our course. \n\n    1.  War in Syria, Assad has fallen and the trap for Erdogan has been activated\n    2.  Israel's bombing of the nuclear program of Persia (Iran) and at that time or shortly after\n    3.  Erdogan's fall by biological means or by assassination.\n    4.  The new pro-Western government of Turkey will approach and occupy 3 Greek islands, then Russia will hit Turkey everywhere. NATO will also already be participating... \n\n The entire planet will be in turmoil, no one will feel safe.\n \n\n I hope everyone finds the divine grace of the Holy Spirit because it is the most wonderful thing a person will ever experience.\n In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Chart Overview:\n- Timeframe: 4-hour (4H) candlestick chart.\n- Current Price: $292.00 (visible on the chart).\n- Trend: The price appears to be consolidating in a reaction zone near significant support levels.\n\n2. Key Levels (Support & Resistance):\n- Support Levels:\n  - $277.18: Close to the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement, a significant support level.\n   - $292.00: Current price level acting as interim support. \n  - $289.80: EMA 200 level, which often serves as a strong support line in technical analysis.\n\n3.

Fibonacci Analysis:\n- Retracement Levels:\n  - The price is hovering near the 61.8% retracement level ($289.80), a key zone for potential reversals.\n  - Holding above this level could signal a bullish rebound, while a breakdown might lead to a test of deeper Fibonacci levels.\n\nPotential Trade Strategies: Bullish Rebound:\n   - Entry: Around $290-$292 (near current price and EMA 200 support).\n   - Target: $328 (23.6% Fibonacci) or $351 (EMA 50 level).",

        "description": "The New Year is looking bright for Bitcoin with the most recent report from Franklin Templeton predicting \u201cnations to adopt strategic Bitcoin reserves in 2025.\u201d It should be interesting to see how sustainable it will be for Bitcoin to be a practical method to both store and transfer value, given its TPS limitation as more Nations and Institutions become larger players on the chain. I believe this presents an incredible opportunity for quality POW governance tokens to shine and become a very real complementary alternative.\n\nBut I digress \u2013 what\u2019s up with Big Daddy Bitcoin and the No Santa Rally?\n\nOn the LTF (1D) Point and Figure, the formation is currently printing a distribution pattern, forming a Last Point of Supply (LPSY) at a local high of $96,000 to retest the prior local high at $95,400 Bitcoin established after moving into Phase D Distribution of the distribution cycle. True to form in Phase D of a Distribution Cycle, the formation printed the preliminary sign of weakness, dropping to the $91,400 handle before the retest.\n\nThe characteristic of Phase D Distribution is a Major Sign of Weakness occurs at the end of Phase D which \u201cBreaks the Ice\u201d of the lower level of support (in this case $90,800). The horizontal price count suggests a potential near-term fall from the current level to the $$86,600 region from a Major Sign of Weakness (MSOW), before a relief rally to \u201cReturn to Ice\u201d and subsequent Preliminary Support (PS) and Selling Climax (SC) are established.\n\nThe positive take should be on the Higher Time Frame (HTF), this PA is all about establishing the bottom of the new Trade Range, which has recently established the $108,300 handle at the upper limit of this Trade Range. Consolidation within this range should happen for a bit to establish both future direction and build cause within the formation to build potential (much like coiling a spring) for the next move.\n\nAlways remember this is not trading advice.\n\nOutside of that, Happy Trading.",

        "description": "CLSK \nPotentially a Double Bottom forming on the daily chart.\nWhen the next low is printed I\u00b4m going to pay attention to if the daily chart prints Bullish Divergence on the RSI. If yes and we see upwards momentum in price with continuation it would confirm that the bottom is in for CLSK and we go up from here.... Possibly in to a parabolic phase of the market which also signals the end is near. for this cycle. \n\n BTC \nThis all is dependent on what the price does for BTC. The BTC chart is a leading indicator when analyzing and trading CLSK. If/when BTC sets in the low of the present correction and pushes price up with continuation, first then the price of CLSK has a chance to break to the upside.\n\n MARKET SENTIMENT \nRight now in time of writing the market sentiment is cracking and the FEAR & GREED indicator is at 64 signaling that we are starting to see a reset of the market sentiment. This indicates that people that is suffering losses on their trade are willing to sell at a loss in order to salvage their hard earned money. A reset of the market sentiment is good for future price apreciation \n\"It is always the dumpiest before the pumpiest\" as one smart guy once said. \n\n WHERE IN THE CYCLE ARE WE? \nZooming out and watching previous cycle leading in to the CLSK top in 2021 we see that CLSK topped out 100 days before BTC did. Now one can assume that both BTC and CLSK are more mature assets now. How that affect its price-action we will hopefully live to see.\n\n VOLUME \nLooking at the volume on the chart we can see there is a substantial amount of volume traded at this times of lower prices... sellers are leading the race hence the price declines BUT... WHO is buying? Is it retail? I don\u00b4t think so... keep in min the market sentiment is cracking at the moment and scared money is probably letting go of their positions.\n\n FUNDAMENTALS/b]\nI believe CLSK is a bargain at $10. Why? Because they at the time of writing are mining bitcoin at a cost of around $55k / BTC and a time when price is around $100k / BTC, AND they are hodling their bag, i.e. not selling. \n\n Accounting  The FASB have adopted the FAIR VALUE ACCOUNTING for companies holding BTC and that could potentially boost the value of CLSK significantly, watch next earnings report. \n\n Dilution  CLSK have been diluting their shares significantly over the last year. In doing this they have been growing their hashrate to stay competitive which is good in the long run, shitty in the short run. \nThe last vote on issuing more common stock got approved in Q4 2024, in doing this they mitigate the dilution by featuring a capped call option meaning they will not be diluting any more shares until price reaches above $24.\n\n MACRO \nThe liquidity has been increasing during 2024, i.e. there has been money printing by lowering interest-rates and other stimulatives.  Jerome Powell raised a finger for inflation concerns as we move in to 2025 leading to a market decline as the fears are the liquidity (money printing) will slow in 2025.\n\n COUNTER ARGUMENT \nIf the liquidity injection slows down in 2025 we will probably see markets turn over and a recession is likely to kick in full throttle. This would take us in to a bearmarket and all bullish bets are of.\n\n CONCLUSION \n BULL  If the bullish bet is on I am expecting price to reach at least $24 before dilution starts to kick in. \n\n BEAR  If the moneyprinter stops all bets are of and we sell our bags to fight another day.",

        "description": "Hi fellow traders, Crypto21Official here! \ud83d\ude80\n\nAfter a strong impulse in the crypto market, we\u2019ve had a teaser of what could be an alt season. The crypto market cap chart (excluding the top 10) showed a beautiful surge to $450 billion, a key level that marked the recent high.\n\nSince then, we\u2019ve retraced around 27%, and the downtrend appears to be losing momentum. Right now, we\u2019re dipping into a key buy zone, where I\u2019ve marked a potential double-bottom pattern. If confirmed, this could signal a bullish reversal and set the stage for further growth.\n\nOn the Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) chart, we still see room for dominance to rise slightly before a healthy decline could pave the way for a full-blown alt season. Historically, such patterns have preceded explosive altcoin growth.\n\n Why Could January Be a Game-Changer? \n\n \n Tax-Loss Harvesting Rebound: As the year ends, investors often sell assets to optimize for tax benefits. By January, these funds tend to flow back into the market, sparking renewed interest.\n U.S. Election Cycle Momentum: Political developments surrounding the U.S. election cycle could act as a macro catalyst, influencing risk-on markets like crypto.\n Historical Patterns: As we\u2019ve seen before:\nBitcoin typically leads the market with a strong rally.\nAltcoins dip or consolidate.\nThen, altcoins blast off, following Bitcoin\u2019s momentum. \ud83d\ude80\n \n\n My Take \nI remain bullish, expecting January to be a pivotal month for Bitcoin, which could open the floodgates for altcoins to follow. History doesn\u2019t repeat itself, but it often rhymes. Let\u2019s see if the market plays along. \ud83c\udf15\n\nWhat are your thoughts? Are we on the brink of something big?

The idea behind a \"significant\" step up can just as well be a tactic to obscure the downtrend. On my Day chart I see a classic Head and Shoulders formation that so far does seem to hold, and I set a \"take profit\" well above the rumored 32k but low enough to not have to watch it by the minute.\n\nThis is just my opinion on the immediate direction of BTC amid rumblings of a possible return to a gold standard (not only by Trump who comes into real authority to do so as of January 2025, but also by BRICS nations, and the various reports of gold bar buying around the world in the past few years).\n\nAs always, do your own due diligence.

This key level has the potential to define the next phase of its upward movement and will be critical for assessing whether the bulls can sustain the rally.\n\n\ud83d\udc8eOn the downside, Solana is supported by the ascending trendline in the $188\u2013$186 range, with additional horizontal support at $186\u2013$183.80.

It would be an understatement to say that the development, features, and rollout have be clumsy at best.  Not only has the rollout and announcements been underwhelming, but Apple looks to be playing catchup with technology competitors have already well established in the market.  \n\nApple continues to be a loved brand worldwide, and there's no denying the brand loyalty is still strong, however lagging technology, premium prices on their products, high PE/valuation with flat to declining revenue and profitability.  Until Apple can either reclaim it's technological advantage by becoming a leader again in the market, or reposition it's product offering and pricing to drive demand, it's difficult fundamentally see why the stock is worth the PE with so many other companies in market with new innovation and growth potential comparatively.\n\nThis isn't to suggest Apple will collapse, but a correction technically and fundamentally is warranted near term with broader economic risks and technological missed expectations that could warrant lower prices.\n\nMy Position:\n5 Put Options\n$250 Strike, Current Price $252.20\nExpiration Friday Jan 10th\nAverage Price is $2.00 a contract\nInvestment $1000\nTarget $10.00-$16.00 (8-14:1 Profit Loss Ratio)\nStop $1.00\nPotential Loss -$500\nPotential Gain $4000-$7000",

While the timeframes differ, the fractal nature of the market validates this comparison.\n\u2800\n\nBoth charts show clear break-of-structure patterns with higher-low formations. On the BTC weekly chart, three BOS moves have occurred since the last low, mirroring 2 break of structures on the BNB chart.

        "description": "BINANCE:SUIUSDT  is currently consolidating after reaching the psychological level at 5.00. It\u2019s been moving back and forth, forming lower highs while bouncing off the trendline. The last two weeks of December and the first two weeks of January were characterized by sideways movement last year, and it appears we may be experiencing a similar situation now. It\u2019s important to note that there was a strong bullish impulse leg before, but the price failed to continue moving higher, indicating a lack of bullish momentum to sustain that upward movement. This suggests that we might see some bearish action in the near term, potentially setting the stage for a stronger bullish move later on. I expect the market to retest at least channel border. My goal is support zone around 3.61\n\n\n Traders, if you liked this idea or if you have your own opinion about it, write in the comments. I will be glad \ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83d\udcbb  ",

The setup looks promising, supported by a previous upward/downward trend with increasing volume and momentum, presenting an excellent reward-to-risk opportunity.\n\nHMT (High Momentum Trending):\nHMT is based on trend, momentum, volume, and market structure across multiple timeframes. It highlights setups with strong potential for upward movement and higher rewards.\n\nWhenever I spot a signal for my own trading, I\u2019ll share it. Please note that conducting a comprehensive analysis on a single timeframe chart can be quite challenging and sometimes confusing. I appreciate your understanding of the effort involved.\n\nImportant Note :\nRole of Key Levels: \n- These zones are critical for analyzing price trends. If the key level zone holds, the price may continue trending in the expected direction. However, momentum may increase or decrease based on subsequent patterns.\n\n- Breakouts: If the key level zone breaks, it signals a stop-out. For reversal traders, this presents an opportunity to consider switching direction, as the price often retests these zones, which may act as strong support-turned-resistance (or vice versa).\n\n- The market is highly dynamic and constantly changing. HMT signals and target profit (TP) levels are based on the current price and movement, but market conditions can shift instantly, so it is crucial to remain adaptable and follow the market's movement.\n\nMy Trading Rules\nRisk Management\n- Maximum risk per trade: 2.5%.\n- Leverage: 5x.\n\nExit Strategy \nProfit-Taking:\n- Sell at least 70% on the 3rd wave up (LTF Wave 5).\n- Typically, sell 50% during a high-volume spike.\n- Adjust stop-loss to breakeven once the trade achieves a 1.5:1 reward-to-risk ratio.\n- If the market shows signs of losing momentum or divergence, ill will exit at breakeven.\n\nIf you find this signal/analysis meaningful, kindly like and share it.\nThank you for your support~\nSharing this with love!\n\nHMT v2.0:\n- Major update to the Momentum indicator\n- Reduced false signals from inaccurate momentum detection\n- New screener with improved accuracy and fewer signals\n\nHMT v3.0:\n- Added liquidity factor to enhance trend continuation\n- Improved potential for momentum-based plays\n- Increased winning probability by reducing entries during peaks\n\nHMT v3.1:\n- Enhanced entry confirmation for improved reward-to-risk ratios",

Notable transactions include:\n\n- Two whale wallets, \u201c6ZFcxR\u2026JkZV\u201d and \u201cHRQXKj\u2026bVFr,\u201d purchased 2.62 million tokens worth $4.34 million.\n- Wallet \u201cFU9b2c\u2026fHyc\u201d acquired 1.19 million tokens for $1.65 million.\n- Wallet \u201cB6FsUN\u2026XzDV\u201d purchased 869K tokens for $1.09 million.\n- Wallet \u201cAVLKwK\u2026x1Mv\u201d bought 998K tokens for $1.22 million.\n\nThese high-profile purchases reflect growing confidence in AI16Z\u2019s potential, with whales positioning themselves for future gains as the project garners attention within the crypto and AI sectors.\n\nTechnical Analysis\nAI16Z\u2019s price action reveals a bullish flag pattern that triggered the recent 30% surge. However, this rally has faced short-term resistance, with the price currently up 0.26% and trading at $1.71. Here\u2019s what the charts suggest:\n\n- Support Levels:\n  - Immediate support at $1.33, aligning with the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level.\n  - A potential dip to this level (an 18% correction) could create a buy opportunity for traders.\n\n- Resistance Levels:\n  - Current resistance at $1.77, the recent high.\n  - A breakout above this level could push the price towards new highs, potentially targeting $2.00.\n\n\n\nAI16Z\u2019s Vision and Innovation\nAI16Z is more than just a token; it represents a paradigm shift in AI-driven ventures. Here\u2019s what sets it apart:\n\n- AI Leadership: The project is led by AI agents, a pioneering move in the venture capital space.\n- Ecosystem Development: AI16Z aims to connect AI entrepreneurs, investors, and experts, fostering innovation in a rapidly evolving sector.\n\n- Future Plans: The introduction of a launchpad for AI-driven projects using the Eliza framework promises sustained value accrual. AI16Z is also poised to become the primary currency for agent-to-agent transactions, incentivizing developers and enhancing ecosystem utility.\n\nMarket Context and Performance\nAI16Z\u2019s current market dynamics highlight its growing prominence:\n\n- Market Cap: $1.8 billion, ranking #201 on CoinMarketCap.\n- Trading Volume: $256 million in the last 24 hours, signaling strong market activity.\n- All-Time High: $1.771, achieved recently.\n- All-Time Low: $0.002979, recorded two months ago, marking a 2,791.76% increase since then.\n\nThe broader crypto market\u2019s focus on AI-related projects has bolstered AI16Z\u2019s appeal, with analysts attributing its rally to advancements in AI technology and strategic whale accumulation.\n\nConclusion: What\u2019s Next for AI16Z?\nAI16Z\u2019s recent surge underscores its potential as a leader in decentralized AI innovation. While a short-term correction to $1.33 could be on the horizon, the project\u2019s robust fundamentals and whale-backed confidence suggest sustained upward momentum in the long run.\n\nAs AI technology continues to reshape industries, AI16Z is well-positioned to capitalize on this trend, making it a token to watch in 2024 and beyond. Traders and investors should keep an eye on key support and resistance levels, as well as upcoming developments in the project\u2019s ecosystem.",

Key Support Zone: The price is respecting the strong horizontal support level near 1.2500, aligning with the channel's lower boundary.\n\n\n2. Trendline Bounce: A reversal from this zone could indicate the continuation of the bullish trend within the channel.\n\n\n3. Target Zone: A breakout is anticipated to reach the target level of 1.2629, representing a significant upside potential.\n\n\n4. Risk Management: Stop-loss can be placed below the support zone at 1.2480 to minimize downside risk.\n\n\n\nThis idea aligns with current market dynamics, presenting a high-probability setup for traders.

        "description": "CDSL: Poised for New Highs with Strong Support and Bullish Momentum \n\n Weekly Technical Analysis of CDSL Stock \nThe CDSL stock is currently showing strong bullish momentum on the weekly chart. After a healthy retracement, it has taken support in the 1705\u20131715 zone, which aligns with the 1.618 Fibonacci extension level. This level has acted as a solid support base, enabling the stock to consolidate and prepare for the next upward move.\n\n Key Observations: \n\n \n Fibonacci Levels: The stock is poised to aim for the next Fibonacci extension level at 2.618 (2,485), which is a potential target for new highs if the bullish momentum continues.\n Moving Averages: The stock remains well above the 20, 50, and 200-week moving averages, confirming a long-term uptrend.\n MACD Indicator: The MACD line is above the signal line, reflecting sustained bullish momentum.\n Volume: Strong volumes during the recent breakout indicate robust buying interest.\n Outlook: As long as the support at 1705\u20131715 holds, the stock is expected to maintain its bullish trajectory. Traders can watch for further confirmation as the stock approaches its next resistance level near 2,485, as indicated by the Fibonacci extension.\n\n \n",

In this article, we will analyze the technical analysis of this index and consider a scenario in which the price could decline to the support of the channel floor at 19,420.0 if the key resistance at 21,418.4 holds.\nThe scenario ahead\nIn technical analysis, support and resistance levels play a decisive role in predicting future price movements. Here, we will consider a scenario in which the price could decline to the support of the channel floor at 19,420.0 if the resistance at 21,418.4 holds.\n\n1. Holding the resistance at 21,418.4\nIf the price fails to break the resistance at 21,418.4 and remains below this level, it indicates a continuation of the downtrend. This scenario seems likely given the current selling pressure in the market.\n\n2. Moving towards support at 19,420.0\nIf the resistance holds, the price is likely to decline towards the channel floor support at 19,420.0. This level is considered a strong support area that may trigger a price reversal or temporary consolidation.",

I realized that the best and most comprehensive summary was provided by Bitcoin itself. If you look at Bitcoin's annual chart, you'll see that we've had the best and greenest year in the past five years, indicating that Bitcoin adoption has significantly increased. It\u2019s likely that the miraculous halving of 2016 will be repeated for two reasons: 1. The amount of Bitcoin held on exchanges has decreased to the point where it's lower than the level of 2016. 2. In 2016, Bitcoin was in the process of global adoption, and in 2025, it will enter the second phase of global adoption, which can clearly be seen in a famous chart called the \"S curve.\" Additionally, at the bottom of the image, you can see the dominance of Tether, which clearly shows what has happened to it and will continue to happen. This indicates that investors are confident in the bullish market and have moved their capital out of stablecoins.\n By the way, isn't it beautiful that the annual candle will close in a few hours? You will be able to see such an image a year from now.\n\n\n\n",

Just below that is the 4H 200 EMA which coincides with the bullish OB creating what should be a strong level of support. Naturally the invalidation for a trade at the level would be acceptance under these key supports. \n\nThere is a clear LTF downtrend, a breakout of that range could be a good trigger for a long position with the range quarters acting as take profit levels. With alts still very much tied to BTC and as it stands the price action is stagnant due to end of year window dressing and lack of volume, this should change next week and if the ETFs continue inflows this will help HBAR and alts increasing the positive probability of the long. If BTC starts the year poorly then the SL comes in as the bullish trend is lost. \n\n\n\n",

        "description": "WISH YOU ALL A VERY HAPPY NEW YEAR 2025 \n\n\n Introduction \n\nIn the previous trading session (1-Jan-2025), we identified critical levels, including the Golden Retracement Zones for buyers and sellers, along with significant support and resistance areas. The actual price action aligned closely with the outlined plan, particularly near the Opening Support/Resistance Zone at 51,096, where price consolidated (yellow trend) before making a move. Trends in the chart followed the predicted behavior: green trends indicated bullish moves, red trends reflected bearish momentum, and yellow zones suggested a sideways market.\n\n Trading Plan for 2-Jan-2025 \n\n Gap-Up Opening (200+ points) \n\n    If Bank Nifty opens above 51,232 (Opening Resistance), monitor the first 15-minute candle for confirmation.\n  Sustaining above 51,232 may lead to a bullish move targeting the Golden Retracement Zone for Sellers at 51,659.\n  Profit booking is advised in the zone between 51,500\u201351,659, as this area could act as a strong resistance.\n  If price struggles to hold above 51,232, expect a pullback towards 51,096 (Opening Support/Resistance Zone).\n  Place a stop loss below 51,096 to manage risk and protect gains.\n \n\n Flat Opening \n\n    If Bank Nifty opens flat near 51,096, observe whether it breaks out above 51,232 or breaks down below 50,902 (Golden Retracement Zone for Buyers).\n  A breakout above 51,232 indicates bullish momentum towards 51,659. Follow the gap-up scenario for targets and stop loss placement.\n  A breakdown below 50,902 may result in bearish momentum, targeting 50,665 and eventually 50,235 (Buyer's Support).\n  Avoid trading within the Opening Support/Resistance Zone unless a clear breakout or breakdown occurs.\n  Wait for a confirmation candle to reduce the risk of false breakouts.\n \n\n Gap-Down Opening (200+ points) \n\n    If Bank Nifty opens below 50,902, observe the first 15-minute candle to determine whether the price sustains.\n  Sustaining below 50,902 may lead to a bearish move, targeting 50,665 and further towards 50,235 (Buyer's Support).\n  If the price bounces back above 50,902, anticipate a recovery towards 51,096. Monitor this zone for possible reversals or continuation.\n  Place a stop loss above 50,902 for short trades to manage risk effectively.\n  Avoid entering trades impulsively; let the levels guide your decisions.\n \n\n Risk Management Tips for Options Trading \n\n    Utilize stop losses to cap potential losses, especially in volatile markets.\n  Trade with a defined risk-reward ratio; aim for at least 1:2.\n  Avoid overtrading; focus on quality setups that align with the plan.\n  Consider theta decay when holding options overnight or during consolidation phases.\n  Diversify positions to mitigate single-direction risks and preserve capital.\n \n\n Summary and Conclusion \n\nThe trading plan for 2-Jan-2025 emphasizes a systematic approach based on observed levels and trends. Key areas to watch include 51,232, 51,096, 50,902, and 50,665. Use the outlined scenarios to adapt to the market's opening behavior. Green, yellow, and red trends provide clarity on expected bullish, sideways, and bearish movements, respectively. Adhering to proper risk management principles and executing trades with discipline will increase the likelihood of success.\n\n Disclaimer : I am not a SEBI-registered analyst.

However, it underperformed compared to global peers due to sluggish corporate earnings and significant foreign fund outflows. The index reached record highs in September but entered correction territory by November, influenced by record foreign selling in October and slowed earnings growth. \n\n\nAnalysts anticipate that in 2025, the Nifty 50 may experience increased volatility, potentially ranging between 28,000 and 29,000 points. This projection is based on expected market fluctuations and mixed economic indicators. \n\n\nOverall, the Nifty 50's performance will likely be influenced by factors such as corporate earnings, foreign investment flows, and global economic conditions. Investors are advised to monitor these developments closely to make informed decisions.\n\nRecent Developments in Nifty 50 Performance",

I can see where I over traded and when/where I made some much needed tweaks. \n\nThe tweaks that were made we're so much my strategy as much as it was mindset - taking fewer trades and letting them run longer. On average 2-4 hours.\n\nI learned so many lessons the main one being less   truly is more  .\n\nSo often I would struggle looking at my losing trades and really reviewing my mistakes. Looking at my metrics on my Topstep account allowed me to refine my mindset. I knew when my most profitable days were/are, how long I should hold my trades to allow them to play out to full TP, and arguable the most important stat - when to stay out of the market.\n\nBy analyzing just these three metrics I was able to end the year in profit and believe it or not I was able to finish 4 out of 6 months in profit and get funded/pass my trading combine/evaluation.\n\nThis isn't the first time I've been funded. However this is the first time and longest time I have kept my account and the closest I have gotten to a payout.\n\nMy trading goals for 2025 is to of course get 1 payout per month and earn 4 more funded Topstep funded accounts. This will max out the number of accounts I can have with Topstep. The best part is I can put all 5 accounts on their integrated trade copier.\n\nI decree and declare over myself that 2025 is going to be my best, most profitable, and most prosperous year to date - IN JESUS NAME!

Here, we will examine a scenario where the price could decline to the channel floor support at 1.0241 if the resistance at 1.0371 holds.\n\n1. Holding Resistance at 1.0371\nIf the price fails to break the resistance at 1.0371 and remains below this level, it indicates a continuation of the downtrend. This scenario seems likely given the current selling pressure in the market.\n\n2. Moving towards support at 1.0241\nIf the resistance holds, the price is likely to decline towards the channel floor support at 1.0241. This level is considered a strong support area that may trigger a price reversal or temporary consolidation.",

        "description": "Basic little draw up from now just checking market sentiment with the MACD providing great analytical insight into where we are NOW and were we were MID bull run from $75k ATH to $109k. See the bearish MACD over the ATH of 75k and the same over the 109k ATH. We are back to zero on MACD we should see small dips or sideways movement but more volatile as price is higher. It will always seem more volatile as %s of BTC price are larger. So 10% drop or gain now on $93k is $9.3k where when 1  CRYPTOCAP:BTC  was 9.3k 10% drop or gain was only $930! Yes same % loss or gain but more capital required to make or loose hat 10%. Still you can always order less but this is just a sentiment driver when you look at the % math of now and back in the day even 4 years ago or pre covid.\n\nCurrently we sit at $93,250 USD at time of writing. Up from the down turn to $91k. IF we keep the market moving up growing and more $ flow in to longs and or buying bitcoin the better. \n\nI think also as its in a DIP phase people WONT be selling who brought in at or between 50k-80k. At least I wouldn't be. Even if it goes to any price pre Covid so under 25k~ This will take a while to occur with many chances to exit before or you will see much increase from where we are now.\n\nThe market sentiment is good. Its down but its still dominant and will be for another 10 - 100 years plus. It's almost perfect and the coins doing other things BTC can mostly achieve but in directly. However it is no1 and will stay that way for some time. \n\nLove you Holders let us know you thoughts on this projection to upward of $200k within a few 6 months ?  \n\nNot finical advice I trade on my own and use my own methods the post here isn't method to trade its just an assumption of what could happen with little degree of success.

        "description": "The daily chart of Ethereum (ETH) against Tether (USDT) exhibits a series of zigzag patterns suggesting high volatility with distinct peaks and troughs. The current setup indicates a consolidation phase near key support levels, which could dictate the near-term trend based on breakout directions.\n\nPrice Action and Trend:\nEthereum has recently shown signs of consolidation after a significant drop, indicating a potential base formation around the key support level. The chart presents a choppy yet significant retracement within the larger bullish context, evidenced by the higher lows sequence over the longer term.\n\nKey Technical Levels:\nResistance Levels (R1):\nR1: $4,066.49 - Represents the immediate resistance level. Overcoming this barrier may open the path to retest higher levels near the all-time highs.\nSupport Levels (S1, S2, and S3):\nS1: $2,998.25 - Current major support, where price consolidation is evident.\nS2: $2,793.91 - A break below S1 could lead to a test of this lower support zone, which could act as a new base for the next bullish leg.\nS3: $2,101.09 - A critical long-term support level that may come into play if a significant bearish trend develops.\nTechnical Indicators:\nMACD: The MACD line is below the signal line, indicating bearish momentum in the short term. The increasing distance between the MACD and its signal line could suggest strengthening bearish pressure.\nRSI: The RSI is currently just below the neutral 50 mark, which aligns with the consolidation phase. This indicates a balanced market sentiment with a slight bearish inclination.\nVolume:\nThe trading volume shows fluctuation with peaks aligning with significant price movements. An increase in volume, particularly on downward movements, may validate bearish sentiment.\n\nConclusion and Forecast:\nEthereum's price action is at a crucial juncture, with its position near major support levels suggesting potential for either a rebound or further declines. The key to upcoming trends lies in the ability of bulls to defend the $2,998.25 support level effectively.\n\nTrading Strategy:\nBullish Scenario: Watch for a stable hold or a bounce off the $2,998.25 level, aiming for a move towards $4,066.49. A break above this could target previous highs.\nBearish Scenario: A breakdown below $2,998.25 could accelerate declines towards $2,793.91 or even $2,101.09 as bearish momentum builds.\nSummary:\nThe ETH/USDT chart points to a significant testing ground for both bulls and bears at the current levels. Traders should closely monitor volume and price action at these key technical junctures to gauge potential breakout or breakdown directions.",

A clean break above $2,660 could signal further bullish momentum.\nDemand Zone: The price is reacting around the $2,640 level, indicating buying interest.\nEntry Strategy:\n\nLook for bullish confirmation around the FVG/demand zone ($2,600-$2,640).\nA clear break above $2,658 and consolidation would confirm bullish continuation.\nTargets:\n\nTP1: $2,687 \u2013 aligned with a minor resistance level.\nTP2: $2,727 \u2013 at the upper resistance near the supply zone.\nRisk Management:\n\nStop-loss should be placed below the demand zone, near $2,593, to limit downside risk.\nOutlook:\n\nBullish opportunities are favorable if price maintains support at key zones and forms higher lows. Watch for breakout confirmation above structural resistance.  FX:XAUUSD  ",

        "description": "XAUUSD Analysis (Gold Spot/USD) \n\n\ud83d\udcca  Timeframes Analyzed: \n \n-  1H Chart (Left):  Price is trading within a descending channel, showing a clear bearish structure. The current movement has reached the upper boundary of the channel, aligning with a significant supply zone (marked in red). Additionally, the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement level reinforces this area as a potential reversal point.  \n\n-  15m Chart (Right):  A closer look at price action reveals consolidation within the highlighted supply zone, indicating indecision and potential exhaustion of bullish momentum. A breakdown below the zone could trigger a continuation to the downside.\n\n\ud83d\udd11  Key Levels:   \n\n-  Resistance Zone:  2,627 - 2,628  \n-  Support Levels:  2,615 (0.618 Fibonacci) and 2,610 (0.786 Fibonacci)  \n\n\ud83d\udcc9  Outlook:   \n\nThe bearish bias remains intact as long as price respects the descending channel and fails to break above the supply zone. A rejection from this area could lead to a move toward lower Fibonacci levels or even test the bottom of the channel.  \n\n\ud83d\udca1  Note:  Monitor price action closely for confirmation before entering trades. A breakout above 2,628 could invalidate the bearish scenario.",

The technical setup remains bearish: the 20-period moving average acts as dynamic resistance at 1.0470, while the 100 and 200-period moving averages confirm the downward trend. Technical indicators are weak and lack clear direction, highlighting the absence of bullish momentum. Key support is at 1.0370, with immediate resistance levels at 1.0440 and 1.0470.\n\nFundamentally, the Dollar benefits from a stronger US economy and expectations of less accommodative monetary policies, while the Euro faces pressure from weak sentiment and uncertain economic prospects in the Eurozone. Key events, such as the Global Outlook Report and the FOMC meeting in January, could increase volatility.\n\nIn the short term, the outlook remains bearish with the risk of approaching parity. However, the medium and long term could offer buying opportunities, supported by potential economic recovery in Europe and a weaker Dollar after the peak in US interest rates.",

        "description": "Support and Resistance Levels:\nSupport Levels: These are price points (green line/shade) where a downward trend may be halted due to a concentration of buying interest. Imagine them as a safety net where buyers step in, preventing further decline.\nResistance Levels: Conversely, resistance levels (red line/shade) are where upward trends might stall due to increased selling interest. They act like a ceiling where sellers come in to push prices down.\nBreakouts:\nBullish Breakout: When the price moves above resistance, it often indicates strong buying interest and the potential for a continued uptrend. Traders may view this as a signal to buy or hold.\nBearish Breakout: When the price falls below support, it can signal strong selling interest and the potential for a continued downtrend. Traders might see this as a cue to sell or avoid buying.\nMA Ribbon (EMA 20, EMA 50, EMA 100, EMA 200) :\nAbove EMA: If the stock price is above the EMA, it suggests a potential uptrend or bullish momentum.\nBelow EMA: If the stock price is below the EMA, it indicates a potential downtrend or bearish momentum.\nTrendline: A trendline is a straight line drawn on a chart to represent the general direction of a data point set.\nUptrend Line: Drawn by connecting the lows in an upward trend. Indicates that the price is moving higher over time. Acts as a support level, where prices tend to bounce upward.\nDowntrend Line: Drawn by connecting the highs in a downward trend. Indicates that the price is moving lower over time. It acts as a resistance level, where prices tend to drop.\nDisclaimer:\nI am not a SEBI registered.

These levels, around $2,650, align with previous consolidation areas.\n\nThe retracement into this discount area (lower half of the recent swing) aligns with smart money logic, buy at lower prices for a move back into premium levels.\n\nThe market remains bullish in the mid-term as long as price doesn\u2019t break below the 2,600 level, which is a key structural support zone.\n\nThe retracement into the Golden Zone is a logical place to anticipate a higher low forming before a continuation to higher levels.\n\nOnce the price finds support in the Fibonacci Golden Zone, the next logical movement would be a return toward the $2,700 liquidity zone.\n\nWait for price to enter the 0.618\u20130.786 zone and confirm support through bullish price action on lower timeframes, you know I trade M1 mostly, so keep an eye in minds!!\n\nTrade safe!!",

We anticipate its price to reach levels between 50 and 55. Once silver surpasses and maintains a position above 37, it presents a substantial upside potential. Conversely, the downside risk appears limited. However, if silver fails to surpass and sustain above 37, it may remain confined within a defined range throughout the year.",

        "description": "Happy New Year, crypto and trading Triends! \n\nI hope you celebrated well! Now it\u2019s time to get serious. I see a short-term opportunity in SOL, with up to 5% upside potential. Here\u2019s why:\n \n Trading below all major moving averages: 50, 100, and 200-day.\n \n \n Positioned near the lower Bollinger Bands line, suggesting potential oversold conditions.\n \n \n Close to the bottom trendline, which could act as a critical support level.\n \n\nSOL remains a fundamentally strong asset, and we\u2019ve observed significant interest from major players, including ETF developments, which could inject fresh money and liquidity into the market.\n\nThat said, caution is key. This is a short-term play with a 5% upside potential in the coming week. If SOL doesn\u2019t show upward movement within a day or two, this narrative could quickly lose its relevance, and the situation would need to be reassessed.\n\nStay tuned,\nMister iM",

        "description": "\nGold has experienced a clear downward trend in the recent period, followed by a certain rebound correction. The current price is fluctuating in an upward channel, indicating that it may be in a correction or rebound stage in the short term.\nThe current price (2624.51) is between the 0.236 and 0.382 areas, indicating that the upward momentum has weakened.\nIf the price breaks through 0.382 (2638.58), it may further test the 0.5 (2655.25) and 0.618 (2671.92) areas.\nThe current price is oscillating in an upward channel, indicating that bulls dominate the market in the short term, but the overall trend still needs to be observed whether it breaks through the upper track.\nThe key support area below is 2610-2620 (green rectangular box), which is an important line of defense for bulls. If it falls below this range, it may retest the low of 2584.61.\nShort-term traders can pay attention to whether the price breaks through the pressure level of 2638.58. Once it breaks through, they can consider going up to around 2655.25.\nMedium-term traders should be alert to the effectiveness of the support below. If it falls below 2610, they need to avoid the risk of further decline.\nThe market is still affected by the game of long and short forces. It is recommended to pay close attention to global macroeconomic events (such as the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision) and changes in market risk aversion.\nIn summary, gold is currently in a correction stage, with a short-term trend of more than 2638.58, but it is necessary to be alert to the risk of a callback. It is recommended to use support and pressure levels as the main reference points.",

Imagine them as a safety net where buyers step in, preventing further decline.\nResistance Levels: Conversely, resistance levels (red line/shade) are where upward trends might stall due to increased selling interest. They act like a ceiling where sellers come in to push prices down.\nBreakouts:\nBullish Breakout: When the price moves above resistance, it often indicates strong buying interest and the potential for a continued uptrend.

Price is now also above the 200dma and this gives me a bullish bias. Ideally, price being contained in the upper part of the triangle would be another factor of confluence. Another one or two bounces off the trendline will add more confirmation. The situation will become clearer in the next few days and continued build up to the bullish side will motivate me to go long with 42,400 as target.\n\n This is not a trade recommendation, merely my own analysis.

Holding above $94,242 could encourage more buyers to enter, fueling the next leg upward.\n2. Next Support at $85,000:\nIf Bitcoin breaks below $94,242, the next key support level is $85,000. This level represents a significant area where buyers may step in to prevent further decline. A drop to this level might shake weak hands but also attract long-term investors looking for a discount.\n\n\ud83d\udcc8 Resistance Levels\n1. Resistance at $100,000:\nIf Bitcoin holds $94,242 and the bulls take control, the next target is the psychological and technical resistance at $100,000. This level is highly significant because it\u2019s a round number that could trigger profit-taking by some traders.

Adding to the bullish narrative, the price is forming an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern\u2014a powerful indicator suggesting the potential for a continuation to higher levels.\n\n\ud83d\udc8eHowever, a significant challenge lies ahead. #SUI faces a major resistance zone between $4.80 and $5.00\u2014a critical level that has repeatedly acted as a barrier, preventing the price from breaking higher. Notably, this range also aligns with the neckline of the pattern, making it a pivotal breakout area.\n\n\ud83d\udc8eA successful breakout, accompanied by strong trading volume, could spark a bullish surge targeting the $5.45\u2013$5.70 range, where the 1.618 Fibonacci extension resides. This area might prompt partial profit-taking as traders capitalize on the move. However, if momentum continues to remain strong, SUI could soar even higher, reaching the next significant resistance levels around $6.50\u2013$6.80, fulfilling the pattern's target.\n\n\ud83d\udc8eOn the downside, SUI is well-supported. Initial support is seen at the $4.00\u2013$3.90 zone, with additional strong support at the ascending trendline near $3.65\u2014a level that has held firm for over 45 days, reinforcing its significance.\n\nPatience and discipline are key here, Paradisers.

        "description": "With many ideas coming into the new year, I'm taking a safe and easy approach. 3 scenarios (generally) to watch for. GREEN: We bust above 96.5 for monthly close and rocket. Maybe a dip to around 82k but the markets are too bullish. YELLOW: variation of green/yellow is what i believe is most likely. I wouldn't be surprised for a sideway ranging until about the 20th of Jan. A bounce off the 200MA would be ideal as well. RED: Total defeat. We lose the 200MA daily...idek, that's not good lol. watch for 64-69k I guess.\n\nIndicators are showing seller exhaustions IMO. Stoch is level out, RSI is battling the 200ma, if it can break above that on the daily, very good sign. The ADX & DI also looking like its full of surprises. Green under Red (DI) with a curving to cross, while the blue lead line (ADX) is bottomed out. We see the green cross the red with the blue lead line trending up shows a move to the upside is likely.\n\nUntil the 20th-21st of January, this market is in limbo. The only reason we are where we are today is because Trump provided crypto with a positive landscape coming into the new year. Will he focus on crypto or will a war/pandemic/whatever steal the headlines. If nothing happens for crypto within the first 2 weeks of his presidency, that's not ideal. I do believe sometime during his admin we will get some type of heavy crypto news. Will it be on the 21st? I don't know. DCA accordingly, Don't unload cash until we get the word. Be ready to exit, Fast if need be.",

        "description": "The **Tulip Mania** of the 1630s was the original bubble\u2014and it was as absurd as it was dramatic. Picture this: a single tulip bulb sold for the price of a luxurious Amsterdam townhouse. Traders flipped tulips like hotcakes, fortunes were made overnight, and the humble flower became a symbol of outrageous wealth and speculation.\n\nThen, in February 1637, the fever broke. Buyers disappeared faster than a Dutch winter thaw, and the market collapsed like a poorly built dike. Those who had mortgaged their futures for tulips were left with nothing but petals and regret. It was a dazzling rise and a catastrophic fall\u2014a timeless lesson in the dangers of speculative greed! \n\n\ud83c\udf37\ud83d\udcc9\ud83c\udf37\ud83d\udcc9\ud83c\udf37\ud83d\udcc9\ud83c\udf37\ud83d\udcc9\ud83c\udf37\ud83d\udcc9\ud83c\udf37\ud83d\udcc9\ud83c\udf37\ud83d\udcc9\ud83c\udf37\ud83d\udcc9\ud83c\udf37\ud83d\udcc9\ud83c\udf37\ud83d\udcc9\ud83c\udf37\ud83d\udcc9\n\nWhy do I write about the Tulip Crash?\nThese days, not many young Trader and Investors know about it. And why not learn from the past?\n\nHappy profits all.\n",

        "description": "After the recent drawdown flushing the liquidity of the last low we have seen a massive push by the bulls back to the upside. This gives us a few key indications. The first indication is that there is still indecision in the market. Whether the market continues up or has a further pullback. These indecision candles are created when the open and close are at a similar price point and also during the period of the candle there is a wick to the upside and downside. \n\nSince this is the monthly chart, this is a very important close for Bitcoin's future. Right now the monthly open for December sits at $96,400. Going into the future this will remain and important liquidity level. Looking back at the past we can see other monthly indecision candles. \n\nIn April 2021, the evening star candle formation signaled the first major reversal since the 2020 bull market began. \n\nIn February 2023, Bitcoin printed a monthly doji. This one is interesting as it did signal a reversal at first. From the open, price dropped 15%, but then something spectacular happened. The bulls stepped in and from the low pushed price up 50% in a single month to save the uptrend! \n\nJanuary 2024 price also formed a monthly doji, but instead of price reversing price immediately started climbing upon the open which lead us to a 43% increase the following  month. \n\nWith this candle being formed, we can guarantee a very volatile January will happen. The main question now is will this indecision candle cause a reversal at first, or will we follow a pattern similar to last January where price negated the reversal and never looked back. ",

Cardano appears to be nearing the completion of Wave B, with expectations of a significant Wave C forming.\n\nHistorically, ADA has found support at the 0.50 Fibonacci retracement (.76), often followed by a recovery after rejection. If the price fails to maintain this support, further downside to the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement around 0.66 is anticipated. A breach below this level could indicate considerable bearish momentum.\n\nLooking ahead, these levels are expected to persist into the new year, with a potential test of support around January 3rd.

        "description": "Technical Analysis: Bitcoin (BTC) \u2013 Regular Bearish Divergence \n\n Hello! \n\n T he recent technical analysis for Bitcoin (BTC) highlights the presence of a regular bearish divergence between the price and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator. This divergence, marked by the yellow lines on the chart, signals a potential reversal in the short-term trend and suggests a bearish outlook for the coming days or weeks.\n\n Understanding the Divergence \n\nA regular bearish divergence occurs when the price of an asset forms higher highs, while the RSI forms lower highs. This indicates weakening momentum, even as the price reaches new peaks. The yellow lines on the TradingView chart clearly illustrate this pattern for Bitcoin.\n\n Price Action:  Bitcoin has recorded higher highs on the price chart.\n\n RSI Behavior:  The RSI indicator, however, has failed to mirror this pattern, instead forming lower highs. This discrepancy points to diminishing bullish momentum and the likelihood of an upcoming price correction.\n\n Short-Term Bearish Implications \n\nGiven the regular bearish divergence, Bitcoin\u2019s price is expected to experience a pullback in the short term. Traders should be cautious, as this divergence often precedes a period of downward movement. Key support levels, such as $93,000 and $92,000, should be monitored closely to assess the depth of the correction.\n\n Long-Term Bullish Outlook \n\nWhile the short-term trend leans bearish, the long-term perspective for Bitcoin remains bullish. Several macroeconomic factors, including increasing institutional adoption, favorable regulatory developments, and a growing use case for cryptocurrencies, continue to support the long-term upward trajectory of BTC. This macroeconomic backdrop suggests that any short-term price corrections could present buying opportunities for long-term investors.\n\n Key Takeaways \n\nThe yellow lines on the TradingView chart highlight a regular bearish divergence between Bitcoin\u2019s price and the RSI indicator.\n\nThis divergence signals a likely short-term bearish trend, with a potential price correction on the horizon.\n\nLong-term trends remain bullish, supported by macroeconomic factors and Bitcoin\u2019s robust fundamentals.\n\n Disclaimer:  This analysis is for informational purposes only and should not be considered financial advice. Always conduct your own research and consult with a financial advisor before making investment decisions. \n\nRegards,\n Ely",

        "description": "The market structure for  MIL:GOAT  signals a possible shift. Yesterday\u2019s low was swept, and price reclaimed a 4H OB cluster. This level could act as support for bullish continuation.\n\nKey Level\n\nThe S/R reflects the 4H OB cluster. A solid defense of this zone supports an upside move. Any close below it weakens the bullish argument, indicating sellers may regain control. A successful hold above the line confirms that recent buyers are willing to defend positions.\n\nEntry Zone\n\nA sweep of yesterday\u2019s lows highlights a liquidity grab. This move often clears out weak longs and sets the stage for a rebound. The 4h OB box represents an area where price might stabilize after that liquidity sweep. If strength emerges, a long entry from this region becomes attractive.\n\nAdding Higher if Momentum Persists\nIf price consolidates above the red line, partial position adds can follow. This approach is contingent on persistent buying. Scattered pullbacks may occur, so verifying each bounce with supportive volume can confirm continued demand.\n\nRisk Management\n\nA stop loss placed under yesterday\u2019s lows.\n\nUpside Focus\nPrice targets often FVGs around local range highs. If buyers maintain control, minor resistance levels may offer partial profit opportunities. Further gains depend on broader market health. No single level guarantees an extended trend, so steady monitoring of daily or 4H closes helps refine targets.\n\nObserving Market Context\nA supportive environment across correlated assets strengthens the bullish narrative. If market sentiment deteriorates, caution is warranted. Sudden volatility can invalidate local setups.",

Let\u2019s dive in.\n\n\ud83d\udc8eBCHUSDT has retraced beautifully within a descending channel, a textbook setup that raises the odds of a potential bullish breakout. However, as always, we must be strategic and patient.\n\n\ud83d\udc8eIf BCHUSDT approaches key support zone after triggering inducement and then begins to form a bullish I-CHoCH (internal change of character) on lower timeframes, the probability of an upward move significantly increases.\n\n\ud83d\udc8eShould the price fail to show any bullish structure and continue to decline, a bounce from the next strong support zone could still be expected. However, the chances of dropping further from that point are relatively low.\n\n\ud83d\udc8ePanic selling could change the game entirely. If BCHUSDT breaks below the strong support zone and closes a candle beneath it, the bullish thesis is invalidated.

MACD , RSI, and Stochastic are in the bull territory but stochastic and RSI are forming negative divergence.   Virtual Protocol is one of the strongest project in this crypto cycle so I am not opening a leverage short position.   However, I took a small profit at $3.50.  I intend to add more to my existing holding and for that I am waiting for the price to clearly fall below the bottom ascending trend line.   I drew the Fib retracement li from $2.2392 to $3.7294 .  Based on that, 0.5 retracement level falls to the previous week mid price level.   0.618 level is where the big buyer block is sitting.  So I will keep an eye on that zone and if the price starts to go up and also all momentum indicators start to point upwards without going into oversold territory, I will buy more.    ",

        "description": "Bitcoin is looking incredibly bullish as it closes the year with strong momentum. The chart shows a textbook breakout pattern with plenty of room for upside. Let\u2019s break it down:\n\n1. Breakout Above Key Resistance\nBTC has smashed through the critical resistance zone around $93,000\u2013$94,000, as shown by the large volume profile on the left side of the chart. This area was previously a heavy consolidation zone, meaning a lot of buyers and sellers were active there. Breaking above this level on strong volume signals a shift in market sentiment, with bulls firmly in control.\n\n2. Bullish Retest in Progress\nAfter the breakout, Bitcoin is now retesting the $93,800\u2013$94,200 level. This is a key area to watch because flipping it into support confirms the breakout. If BTC holds this zone and bounces, it sets the stage for the next leg higher. This kind of retest is a hallmark of strong bullish trends.\n\n3. Clear Upside Targets\nThe chart shows multiple key levels above the current price:\n\n$94,800 (Daily Close Level): The first resistance zone, which BTC is already eyeing.\n$95,400\u2013$96,000 (Swing High Levels): Once BTC clears $95,000, these levels are natural magnets for price action.\nThe stacked targets suggest there\u2019s plenty of room for Bitcoin to climb higher as long as it maintains momentum.\n\n4. Momentum is Building\nThe colorful ribbon around price shows a strong upward trend, with clear bullish momentum. Combined with the surge in volume during the breakout, this indicates buyers are stepping in with conviction. A sustained move above $94,000 will likely attract even more traders and institutions.\n\n5. Strong Weekly and Daily Closes\nClosing the day or week above critical levels like $93,800 and $94,200 would solidify Bitcoin\u2019s bullish case. These closes are key for confirming trends and giving confidence to market participants.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next?\nIf BTC holds the retest zone around $93,800\u2013$94,200, we could see a rally toward $95,000+ very soon. The next major resistance is around $96,000, and breaking that level could open the door for a run toward $97,000\u2013$98,000.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\nBitcoin\u2019s breakout above a major resistance zone, combined with strong volume and a bullish retest, paints a highly favorable picture for the bulls. Keep an eye on the $93,800\u2013$94,200 zone\u2014if it holds, BTC could soar higher as it closes the year with a bang.",

        "description": "Essential Reading for Understanding Markets, Behavior, and Decision-Making\nUnderstanding financial markets and human behavior requires more than just technical knowledge - it demands deep insights into psychology, probability, and decision-making. I've curated a selection of groundbreaking books that together provide a comprehensive framework for mastering these interconnected domains.\nLet's start with Daniel Kahneman's \"Thinking, Fast and Slow,\" a masterpiece that revolutionized our understanding of human decision-making. Kahneman introduces us to two systems that drive our thinking: the fast, intuitive System 1, and the slow, analytical System 2. This book is essential for anyone looking to understand their own cognitive biases and improve their decision-making process, whether in markets or in life.\nBuilding on these psychological insights, Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein's \"Nudge\" explores how choice architecture influences our decisions. Their work demonstrates how subtle changes in how options are presented can significantly impact outcomes - crucial knowledge for both policymakers and investors.\nFor those interested in the intersection of theory and practice, Nassim Nicholas Taleb's \"Incerto\" series (including \"Fooled by Randomness,\" \"The Black Swan,\" and \"Antifragile\") offers profound insights into probability, uncertainty, and risk. Taleb's work challenges conventional wisdom about randomness and helps readers develop more robust mental models for dealing with uncertainty.\nMoving to practical market applications, Edward O. Thorp's \"A Man for All Markets\" provides a fascinating journey from Las Vegas to Wall Street. Thorp, who pioneered quantitative investing, shares valuable lessons about probability, risk management, and the importance of maintaining a mathematical edge in any endeavor.\nGregory Zuckerman's \"The Man Who Solved the Market\" tells the incredible story of Jim Simons and Renaissance Technologies. This book offers rare insights into how mathematical models and data science revolutionized trading, while also highlighting the importance of assembling exceptional teams and maintaining rigorous discipline.\nFinally, George Soros's \"The Alchemy of Finance\" introduces his theory of reflexivity, challenging traditional economic theories about market equilibrium. His insights about how market participants' perceptions affect market reality remain highly relevant today.\nReading these books in combination offers several key benefits:\n\nA deep understanding of human psychology and decision-making\nPractical frameworks for dealing with uncertainty and probability\nReal-world applications of theoretical concepts\nInsights into different approaches to market analysis\nLessons about risk management and system building\n\nThe authors approach markets and decision-making from different angles - psychology, mathematics, philosophy, and practical experience. Together, they provide a rich tapestry of knowledge that can help readers develop more sophisticated mental models for understanding markets and human behavior.\nFor beginners, I recommend starting with \"Thinking, Fast and Slow\" to build a psychological foundation, then moving to \"Nudge\" and the \"Incerto\" series. More market-focused readers might prefer beginning with Thorp's memoir before diving into the theoretical works.\nRemember that understanding markets and behavior is a journey, not a destination. These books don't offer simple formulas for success, but rather frameworks for thinking about complex problems. The real value comes from integrating these different perspectives into your own mental models and decision-making processes.\nWhether you're an investor, trader, policy maker, or simply someone interested in understanding how markets and humans interact, these books provide invaluable insights that can help you navigate an increasingly complex world. The time invested in reading and understanding these works will pay dividends far beyond the financial markets.",

The idea is invalidated if we move above 95k again in the short term.",

Hallo!\ud83c\udf1f\nDear Money Makers & Robbers, \ud83e\udd11 \ud83d\udcb0\n\nBased on \ud83d\udd25Thief Trading style technical analysis\ud83d\udd25, here is our master plan to heist the LTC/USD \"Litecoin vs Dollar\" Crypto market. Please adhere to the strategy I've outlined in the chart, which emphasizes short entry. Our aim is the high-risk Green Zone. Risky level, oversold market, consolidation, trend reversal, trap at the level where traders and bullish robbers are stronger. \ud83d\udc40 So Be Careful, wealthy and safe trade.\ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udfc6\ud83c\udf89\n\nEntry \ud83d\udcc9 : You can enter a Bearish trade at any point after the MA line Breakout,\nhowever I advise placing sell limit orders within a 15 or 30 minute timeframe. Entry from the most recent or closest high level should be in retest.\n\nStop Loss \ud83d\uded1: Using the 2H period, the recent / nearest high level.\n\nGoal \ud83c\udfaf: 88.00\n\nScalpers, take note : only scalp on the Short side. If you have a lot of money, you can go straight away; if not, you can join swing traders and carry out the robbery plan. Use trailing SL to safeguard your money \ud83d\udcb0.\n\nFundamental Outlook \ud83d\udcf0\ud83d\uddde\ufe0f\nEconomic Factors:\nRegulatory uncertainty: Uncertainty and potential regulatory changes, particularly in the US and China, could negatively impact the price of Litecoin.\n\nCompetition from other cryptocurrencies: Increasing competition from other cryptocurrencies, particularly those with similar use cases and technological advancements, could negatively impact the price of Litecoin.\n\nSecurity concerns: Security concerns, such as the potential for 51% attacks or other vulnerabilities, could negatively impact the price of Litecoin.\n\nLack of adoption: Slow adoption and usage of Litecoin, particularly in the payments and e-commerce sectors, could negatively impact the price.\n\nPlease note that this is a general analysis and not personalized investment advice. It's essential to consider your own risk tolerance and market analysis before making any decisions.\n\nWarning\u26a0\ufe0f : Our heist strategy is incompatible with Fundamental Analysis news \ud83d\udcf0 \ud83d\uddde\ufe0f.

Up from wave (W), wave A ended at 43663 and wave B ended at 42928. Wave C higher ended at 43746 which completed wave (X). The Index has turned lower in wave (Y), but it still needs to break below wave (W) at 42496 to validate this view.

        "description": "MVST Valuation Doesn\u2019t Make Sense\nemoji:DDNerd:\n \ud83c\udd33\ud83c\udd33 \nemoji:DDNerd:\nLet\u2019s put things into perspective. Consider KULR, a stock I\u2019ve been bullish on for years (I'm also the KULR subreddit admin). KULR, with $40 million in annual revenue, has a market cap of $300 million. Meanwhile, MVST, with $400 million in revenue and already profitable, is only valued at $390 million. A profitable company trading at less than its annual revenue is a rare opportunity in today\u2019s market.\n\nWhy I\u2019m Extremely Bullish on MVST\n\nRevenue & Profitability: MVST recently reported $101.4 million in Q3 revenue, a 26.6% YoY increase. Their gross margin rose to 33.2% (from 22.3%), and they achieved a net profit of $13.2 million\u2014proof that they\u2019re not just growing but doing so profitably\u200b.\n\nIndustry Comparison: Comparing to KULR again, a market cap-to-revenue ratio of 7.5x would imply MVST deserves a market cap of $3 billion\u2014a 10x from its current valuation. This isn\u2019t just a hypothetical; I\u2019ve seen this happen before with KULR, which 15x\u2019d within a year. (And still giving.)\n\nGrowth Potential: MVST\u2019s 2024 revenue is projected to grow 15-18% YoY, supported by a strong gross margin target of 25-30%. The company\u2019s focus on next-gen battery technologies like solid-state batteries positions it well for sustained growth\u200b.\n\nShort-Term Catalysts to Watch\n\nQ4 Earnings: MVST guided Q4 revenues to $90-$95 million. If profitability continues, expect a significant re-rating of the stock.\n\nLong-Term R&D Success: Their work on silicon-based cells and ESS solutions can open new revenue streams\u200b.\n\nMarket Realization: Historically, the market has corrected misvaluations like this. Dismissive attitudes, similar to what I saw with KULR early on, often precede massive price movements.\n\nTechnical Price Analysis\n\nCurrent Levels: MVST is trading at $1.20, far below its book value. Support levels are forming around $1, with resistance near $1.40.\n\nPotential Upside: If MVST trades at a fair value reflecting its fundamentals, the $10 target isn\u2019t far-fetched. The price could consolidate briefly before breaking out, driven by earnings momentum.\n\nAddressing Bearish Concerns\n\nSome have raised concerns about near-term dilution or declining sequential revenues. While an offering might impact the stock in the short term, MVST\u2019s profitability ensures any capital raised will fuel growth, not just sustain operations. Sequential revenue declines are normal in seasonally affected industries and don\u2019t undermine long-term trends.\n\nConclusion:\nI\u2019m long on MVST. Just as KULR proved skeptics wrong, I believe MVST will too. Its fundamentals are too strong for this valuation to persist. At today\u2019s prices, it\u2019s not just a buy\u2014it\u2019s an opportunity to get in on a stock with 10x potential before the market wakes up.\n\nLet\u2019s discuss\u2014are you bullish, bearish, or somewhere in between?\n\nDisclosure: I\u2019m heavily invested in MVST and KULR.",

        "description": "Hello everyone, Brian here! It's great to connect with you all again!\n\nCurrently, gold prices are hovering around $2,612, marking a decline of over $10.7 from the start of yesterday's trading session.\n\nThis drop comes amid a less optimistic outlook from the Federal Reserve, which is expected to reduce interest rates at a slower pace in 2025. Additionally, with former President Donald Trump set to return to the White House on January 20, his anticipated protectionist policies could lead to even higher inflationary pressures in the future, setting the stage for prolonged higher interest rates.\n\nAs a result, gold remains an attractive instrument to sell during potential recovery attempts, barring unexpected geopolitical tensions such as prolonged conflicts in the Middle East or Eastern Europe.\n\nPay close attention to the $2,615 level. If sellers manage to keep the price below this region, it would be wise to monitor local support levels. A break of these levels would only reinforce the case for a further decline toward the $2,600\u2013$2,596 range.\n\nHow about you? What\u2019s your take on gold in the near future?",

        "name": "SOL/USDT Analysis: Descending Channel Meets Critical Supply Zone",
        "description": "Hey fellow traders! Let's dive into this fascinating SOL/USDT hourly chart that's showing some really interesting technical patterns.\nFirst, what immediately catches my eye is the descending channel (those yellow parallel lines) that's been guiding price action. The text on the chart points out \"Multiple Touches Confirming the trend\" - and they're absolutely right. We've seen several clean touches on both the upper and lower boundaries, which gives this channel formation strong credibility.\nThe current price is sitting at 228.17 USDT, and we're seeing a -1.40% decline. What's particularly interesting is how we're interacting with what the chart labels as a \"Strong Supply Zone From Daily Timeframe.\" This isn't just any supply zone - it's coming from a higher timeframe, which typically carries more weight in technical analysis.\nLooking at the moving averages, we've got both a blue MA (likely the 200-period) and a red MA creating a bearish cross. This adds another layer of confirmation to the current downward pressure.\nFor the short term, we're at a crucial decision point. The price has just bounced off the supply zone (marked by that last circle), showing sellers are still active in this region. That green arrow suggesting potential movement? It's pointing to possible upcoming price action, but remember - these are projections, not guarantees.\nMedium-term outlook shows we're still firmly within that descending channel, and until we see a convincing break above it, the path of least resistance remains downward. Those multiple touches mentioned in the chart have validated this bearish structure.\nLong term? See that purple marker near the bottom? That could be our next major support level if the current structure continues to play out. However, smart traders should watch for any signs of channel breakout, as these patterns don't last forever.\nWhat makes this setup particularly tricky is the confluence of multiple technical factors - the descending channel, the daily supply zone, and the MA crossover. This is exactly the kind of situation where proper risk management becomes crucial.\nRemember folks - while the technical setup looks bearish, Solana is known for its volatility. Keep your stops tight and never risk more than you can afford to lose. Anyone else seeing other interesting patterns here? I'd love to hear your thoughts!",

        "name": "Bitcoin Detailed Analysis: Short-Term and Long-Term Signal",
        "description": "Bitcoin (BTC/USD) is currently trading at a critical inflection zone, where price action indicates potential for significant movement in either direction. Utilizing Fibonacci levels, regression channels, and the high-low structures from the charts, here is a combined analysis for both short-term and long-term scenarios.\n\nCritical Zone: Decision Point\nThe price is hovering near key support and resistance levels, forming a pivotal zone that will dictate the next major trend:\n\nFibonacci Levels:\nThe price is currently in a range between 23.6% ($79K) and 61.8% ($180K) Fibonacci retracement zones, marking a decisive area.\nA drop to $79K (near the 23.6% level) would signal a deeper retracement before a rally, while holding above  FWB:65K  would favor immediate upward momentum.\nRegression Channels:\nThe lower regression channel (support zone) aligns with the $79K level, providing a potential bounce point.\nThe upper regression channel targets $180K, indicating the next major resistance in the long-term bullish trajectory.\nShort-Term Signal (Next Few Weeks)\nBearish Scenario:\nIf Bitcoin loses support at  FWB:65K , it is likely to test the lower Fibonacci zone near $79K:\n\nKey Support Levels:\nImmediate support at $65K.\nMajor support at $25,632 (long-term low).\nIndicators:\nA breakdown below Ichimoku cloud support on the 4-hour chart would confirm bearish momentum.\nRegression channel suggests potential wicks to $79K before recovery.\nBullish Scenario:\nIf Bitcoin holds above  FWB:65K , the price may target the $100K-$120K range as a short-term objective:\n\nKey Resistance Levels:\nShort-term resistance at $85K.\nSecondary resistance at $100K.\nIndicators:\nBreakout above the Ichimoku cloud and higher highs on 4-hour charts confirm bullish momentum.\nA continuation pattern, such as a flag or wedge, could precede a breakout.\nLong-Term Signal (Next 6-12 Months)\nScenario 1: Retest $79K Before Rally:\nIf the price retraces to $79K, it would allow for consolidation and accumulation before targeting the $180K level:\n\nHigh-Low Structure:\nPrevious lows around $25,632 provide a firm base.\nHigher lows from $79K would confirm bullish strength.\nTarget:\nAfter accumulation, a rally toward the $180K Fibonacci target aligns with historical post-correction moves.\nScenario 2: Direct Rally to $180K:\nIf Bitcoin holds above  FWB:65K , the price is likely to aim directly for $180K:\n\nMomentum:\nHigher highs on daily and weekly time frames signal sustained buying interest.\nRegression Channels:\nPrice staying within the upper regression channel strengthens the case for a rally.\nKey Observations:\nHigh-Low Structure:\nA consistent pattern of higher lows supports the bullish case for a long-term uptrend.\nFailure to hold these lows would invalidate the bullish theory in the short term.\nVolume Profile:\nIncreased volume at critical levels (around $79K or  FWB:65K ) will confirm accumulation or distribution.\n\nLong-Term Targets:\nFirst Target: $120K (interim resistance).\nSecond Target: $180K (major Fibonacci level and psychological zone).\n\n Conclusion: \nBitcoin is in a critical zone, and traders should watch  FWB:65K  closely. A break below this level opens the door for a retracement to $79K, where the price could bounce before heading toward $180K. Conversely, if Bitcoin holds above  FWB:65K , the price is well-positioned for an accelerated move toward the long-term target of $180K. Both scenarios align with historical price action and technical indicators, making this a high-stakes moment for BTC.\n\n\n Disclaimer: \nThis analysis is for informational and educational purposes only and should not be considered financial advice.

        "description": "While it\u2019s true that yesterday wasn\u2019t completely void of economic events, a disappointing Chicago PMI can\u2019t really shoulder the blame, or take the credit, for the wild stock market swings that took place. The Dow was down 700 points first thing, on no news. It then rallied 500 soon after the US open, before dropping 200 in the last hour of trading. In S&P terms, that was a loss of 100 points in three hours; a rally of 60 over the following three, topped off with a 30 point slump in the final hour of trading. As they say over the Atlantic: \u201cGo figure.\u201d A clue to what all that was about may be found in the US Treasury market where yields pulled back from recent highs. The 10-year Treasury note lost around 8 basis points yesterday, again on no news. So, like Sherlock Holmes and the \u2018dog that didn\u2019t bark\u2019, it seems fair to suggest that investors were indulging in a dollop of year-end window dressing and rebalancing. Equities have had a strong twelve months, so these were sold off on profit-taking; bonds have had a dreadful fourth quarter, so they got bought, sending yields lower. This should help maintain the traditional 60:40 equity/bond portfolio to which most money managers aspire. That still leaves the 10-year yield over 4.50%, and a potential headwind for equities, although it\u2019s remarkable how quickly investors can acclimatise to new environments. Could a 5.00% yield be the new danger threshold next year, as 4.50% now looks rather tatty and obsolete?  Going forward, there are two related issues that investors are considering: Will growth continue to outperform value?  Can the tech giants continue to lead the market, providing investors with further outsized gains (how does one try to calculate the future returns of generative AI and quantum computing)? Or will the more neglected value stocks take over? That\u2019s all one issue. The second one is: Has the US peaked in terms of market outperformance? Is it now time to rebalance towards Europe and emerging markets? Is China once again an investment opportunity? That\u2019s the other one. Linking all this is where the US dollar is likely to head from here. Yesterday, Jared Dillian, in his \u2018Daily Dirtnap\u2019, posted a chart of the Dollar Index superimposed on the same chart from 2016, around the time of Trump\u2019s first presidential election victory. It shows the Dollar Index peaking around 106.00 a month after the result, then falling to 94.00 eight months later. Will history repeat? We know that President-elect Trump likes low interest rates, and tariffs. Could that be enough to trash the greenback? If so, then 2025 is likely to see higher commodity prices, a bond market rally and a bit of a headwind for US equities. Let\u2019s look forward to finding out. ",

        "description": "As anticipated in our previous analyses, the EUR/USD currency pair experienced significant downward pressure during the late American trading session on Wednesday, hitting its lowest point in almost a month, below 1.0350. Currently, while I am drafting this article, the pair has seen a minor rebound and is trading around 1.0410; however, the technical indicators still suggest a bearish outlook.\n\nThe price is nearing a critical area where it may continue to decline. Our analysis reveals an imbalance on the Daily timeframe that could signal a further downturn. For more detailed insights, please refer to the link provided below.\n\n\n\nFollowing the last Federal Reserve policy meeting of the year, the central bank announced a reduction in its policy rate by 25 basis points, aligning with market expectations, bringing it to a range between 4.25% and 4.5%. In their accompanying statement, the Fed emphasized that they would take into account incoming data, the evolving economic landscape, and the balance of risks when evaluating future rate adjustments.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Fed's decision, the US Dollar (USD) gained substantial strength, leading to a sharp decline in the EUR/USD pair. Moving forward, our outlook suggests the potential for a new bearish correction in the market as we navigate these developments.\n\n Previous close position SHORT \n\n\n\n \n\u2705 Please share your thoughts about EUR/USD in the comments section below and HIT LIKE if you appreciate my analysis.

Again BTC's next movements will have an impact on how this plays out but if it does pump hopefully its only small and i placed my stop well enough to not be closed out of the trade. If BTC doesn't pump we could see XRP dump here.",

        "description": "Throughout the first half of the European trading session on Monday, the Japanese Yen continues to struggle against the US Dollar, with the exchange rate slipping to 0.006436 as I write this article. Investor skepticism regarding the Bank of Japan's (BoJ) potential for further interest rate hikes plays a significant role in this downward trend. This uncertainty, combined with an overall positive market sentiment, is putting pressure on the traditionally safe-haven Yen.\n\nMoreover, the recent widening of the yield gap between US and Japanese government bonds\u2014intensified by the Federal Reserve's hawkish stance\u2014further contributes to the Yen's decline. As the Fed signals a more aggressive monetary policy, the lower-yielding Yen becomes less attractive to investors.\n\nIn terms of market outlook, we are anticipating a continuation of this bearish trend for the Yen against the Dollar.\n\n USD/JPY Previous Idea as reference: \n\n\n\n \u2705 Please share your thoughts about JPY in the comments section below and HIT LIKE if you appreciate my analysis.

Still, as we look at angles and lines symmetrically, it seems to be coming to a head at around 260s, with no confirmation on many indicators and oscillators and no reversal chart pattern indicating jumping in at any point soon.

Resistance Zone (1.50600): This level could act as a ceiling, where price may struggle to break higher.

        "description": "How Base, Ai & Pump Fun Will Shape the Crypto Market in 2025 \n\n 2024: A Milestone Year for On-Chain Growth \n\nThe year 2024 may prove pivotal for onchain development, potentially rivaling the \"DeFi Summer.\" Narrative driven investment opportunities are expected to proliferate, fueled by the widespread adoption of the \u201ceverything can be a Meme\u201d concept and the rapid asset issuance popularized by Pump Fun. Meme projects can now launch without requiring top tier centralized exchange (CEX) listings, with market caps in the onchain space reaching approximately $1 billion. This presents significant profit opportunities for ordinary users, with toptier CEXs serving as the final stage for cashing out on-chain investments.\n\n Challenges for Established Assets  \n\nRising tensions between VCCoin and its community have led to underperformance for new assets listed on major CEXs, while older projects struggle to stay relevant. Many such projects lack motivation or fail to adapt to market changes, often adopting a passive strategy while awaiting unlock periods.\n\n Key Predictions for 2025 \n\n 1. DEX/CEX Monthly Volume Ratio to Exceed 20%  \nIn December 2024, decentralized exchange (DEX) trading volumes hit a record $320 billion, marking over 200% year-over-year growth. The DEX/CEX ratio rose from 9.6% in December 2023 to 11.7%, peaking at 13.9% during the year. Continued improvements in Web3 wallets and on-chain tools, spearheaded by CEXs, along with the growing appeal of the Meme sector, are expected to accelerate user migration from CEXs to DEXs.\n\n 2. AI Agents/AI Meme Market Cap to Eclipse NFTs   \nAI Agents integrated with tokenization have emerged as the fastest-growing narrative, with the total market cap for related tokens reaching $12 billion. Frameworks like ai16z\u2019s Eliza and Virtuals Protocol\u2019s Game Framework have gained dominance, enabling rapid deployment of AI Agent tokens. Virtuals Protocol\u2019s VIRTUAL token leads the sector with a $3.5 billion market cap, bolstered by a robust ecosystem of subtokens.\n\n 3. Emergence of Vertical Launch Platforms  \nThe success of Pump Fun on Solana, a low-cost launchpad for issuing Memecoins, has inspired similar platforms across other networks. Specialized vertical platforms like vvaifu (AI Agents) and Pump Science (DeSci) are gaining traction. The expansion of the \u201ceverything can be a Meme\u201d narrative is expected to drive demand for more niche launchpads.\n\n 4. Base Ecosystem Tokens to Debut on Binance  \nThe Base network, an Ethereum Layer 2 developed under Coinbase, is predicted to have at least five native tokens listed on Binance\u2019s spot market. With a concentrated ecosystem led by Virtuals and Farcaster, Base is positioned as a key contender for listings. Integration with Coinbase Wallet and the potential for favorable U.S. policies could enhance its competitive edge.\n\n 5. Hyperliquid\u2019s Spot Market to Drive Wealth Effects   \nHyperliquid, leveraging its HYPE token airdrops and novel asset standards (HIP1 and HIP2), is positioned to create exclusive wealth-generation opportunities. Projects like Solv Protocol and Azuki\u200a \u200aAnime have utilized its spot listing auctions, attracting significant interest. HYPE\u2019s value, while substantial, will benefit from increased trading volume and partnerships with exclusive projects.\n\nThese projections reflect growing innovation in onchain development, with decentralized finance, AI tokenization, and specialized launchpads driving the next phase of market evolution.",

        "description": "\nThe negative line closed last Friday is very critical. It pierced the 5-day line and the 10-day line in one fell swoop, almost completely swallowing up the positive line last Thursday. This kind of negative-enclosing-positive K-line pattern is a strong signal in technical analysis. It clearly shows that the short-term bullish momentum is extremely weak, and the trend of the market turning down again is becoming more and more obvious. Based on this, the gold market is likely to further expand the downward space this week. Investors can first focus on the long and short competition in the 2610-2600 area. If the market continues to fluctuate within a narrow range above 2600 this week, and the price gradually moves closer to 2600, then judging from the trend, gold is very likely to retreat to the 2580-2570 and 2550-2530 areas again in the later period.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, as long as the 2640 position of the 20-day line above is not effectively broken through, the overall structure of the gold market will still be biased towards the short side. This is like a tug-of-war game, with the bears holding the rope tightly. As long as the bulls fail to break through the key defense line, the bears will have a relative advantage. Combined with the hourly chart trend, the price of gold fell below 2620 last Friday night. Although it rose back above this price in late trading, the space above for it to continue to rebound is very limited. In terms of operations this week, the top can first focus on the short-term pressure level near 2630, and the strong pressure level will focus on the 2640 line. According to the current market situation, it is very likely that gold will come under pressure in the 2635-2630 range. If gold prices move higher then strong resistance around 2640 will need to be focused on.\n\nGold operation strategy: Gold recommends short-term short selling near 2630-2635, stop loss 2642, and target 2620-2610. It is recommended to buy long at 2608-2612 below, stop loss at 2600, and target 2625-2635;",

After experiencing a notable bearish trend, the euro managed to recoup some losses, specifically retesting our pending order at 1.04380. As I write this article on December 23, 2024, the currency pair trades around 1.04130, providing a rejection of our entry point.\n\nOn Monday, the U.S. Dollar (USD) stabilized after a significant drop on Friday. This sell-off was prompted by weaker-than-expected growth in the U.S. Personal Consumption Expenditure Price Index (PCE). Specifically, the core PCE\u2014a key inflation metric favored by the Federal Reserve\u2014rose by 2.8%, falling short of the projected 2.9%. On a month-to-month basis, both headline and core PCE inflation inched up by only 0.1%, leading to speculation about the Federal Reserve's trajectory concerning interest rate adjustments in 2025.\n\nFederal Reserve officials are beginning to signal expectations of fewer rate cuts in the coming year, as the disinflation process appears to be slowing and uncertainties loom over how President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s upcoming immigration, trade, and taxation policies could affect the economy.\n\nGiven the current outlook, we are anticipating a continuation of bearish trends in the market.\n\n Previous Idea: \n\n\n \u2705 Please share your thoughts about EUR/USD in the comments section below and HIT LIKE if you appreciate my analysis.

        "description": "Last Friday, gold took a high-rise and then fell back. The trend is under control, and everyone has witnessed it! Gold opened at $2,633. In the morning, gold slightly retreated and touched $2,628.6, and then rebounded. The highest rebound of gold in the Asian and European sessions reached $2,638, and then it was blocked and fell back. The US session continued to fall and touched the lowest level of $2,611.5. It rebounded in the late trading and finally closed at $2,620.8. The daily line closed with a negative line with upper and lower shadows, and the weekly line closed with a pregnant cross star pattern with an upper shadow slightly longer than the lower shadow. After the end of this pattern, gold was obviously blocked. There is still a need to continue to fall at the beginning of the week. Today, gold focuses on the upper resistance at $2,630. Rebounds rely on shorting below the resistance here, and then look at $2,610 and $2,605 below! The specific operation points are subject to real-time layout!",

        "name": "USD/JPY Surges Higher:US Economic Strength Fuels Dollar Momentum",
        "description": "The USD/JPY exchange rate continues its upward trajectory, aligning with our forecast as robust US economic data bolsters the dollar.\n\nThe price movement reflects the strong momentum of the USD, with the latest Commitments of Traders (COT) report indicating that commercial traders maintain a strong position, while retail investors are riding the wave. Our initial price target is set at 155.050, and beyond that, we anticipate a potential move towards 158.000, where a notable supply zone exists.\n\nRecent US macroeconomic indicators point to significant growth in the fourth quarter. Investor sentiment remains buoyed by expectations that the Federal Reserve may implement interest rate cuts in December. However, the Fed may emphasize the strengthening economic conditions and rising inflation, which could lead to a more hawkish stance in their forward guidance.\n\nConversely, the Bank of Japan is widely expected to maintain its current interest rate levels during Thursday's meeting. This comes after indications of a possible 25 basis point reduction just a week prior. Dovish comments from BoJ officials suggest that the bank will likely postpone any decisions until January to evaluate how US policies under the Trump administration might affect the Japanese economy.\n\nToday's economic calendar highlights US Retail Sales, which are projected to reflect strong consumer spending. This, combined with positive services activity reported earlier this week, is likely to curtail any downside pressures on the US dollar, at least until the Fed meeting's outcome.\n\nWe are optimistic about a continued upward movement in the USD/JPY pair.\n\n \nOur Initial Forecast: \n\n\n\n\n \u2705 Please share your thoughts about USD/JPY in the comments section below and HIT LIKE if you appreciate my analysis.

        "name": "GBP/USD: Anticipating Market Movements Amid Holiday Trading",
        "description": "As the holiday season approaches, many institutional traders are taking a break for Christmas, leading to a unique trading environment in the financial markets. Today marks the reopening of Forex markets and selected indices, but traders should anticipate lower trading volumes due to the absence of many market participants. This reduced activity often results in heightened volatility, as fewer traders can lead to larger price swings when trades are executed.\n\nTurning our attention to the GBP/USD currency pair, it opens the week with a rather narrow candle range, currently trading around the 1.2531 mark. This level underscores the bearish trend that we\u2019ve previously discussed, suggesting a continuation of downward movement in the near term. Traders should closely watch the significant support level at 1.2500, which may come under pressure as we approach the end of the year. There is a legitimate possibility that this demand zone could be breached, particularly with the unique market conditions prevailing during the holiday period.\n\nIf the 1.2500 support does fail, the next area of interest for bearish traders would likely be around 1.2400. This level represents another critical support point, which, if broken, could indicate a strong bearish impulse in the market. As we navigate through the remainder of December, it's essential for traders to be prepared for unexpected moves.\n\nCurrently, we find ourselves in a cautious position, opting to hold off on any trading activity at the moment. Our strategy is to wait for the price to reach our ideal demand area around 1.2500 before considering the next trade. It\u2019s crucial to have a clear plan in place, especially in a market characterized by low liquidity and potential volatility. Monitoring the price action closely will be key to identifying optimal entry points that align with our trading strategy.\n\nAs the year draws to a close, it\u2019s vital to remain vigilant and adaptable. The interplay between reduced market participation and potential volatility could create opportunities, but it also necessitates prudent risk management. Whether we see a bearish momentum take shape before year-end or have to wait for the new year, patience and a disciplined approach will be critical to navigating this unique trading environment.\n\n Previous Idea \n\n\n \u2705 Please share your thoughts about GBP/USD in the comments section below and HIT LIKE if you appreciate my analysis.

And on the other end the BoJ did not increase the Interest Rates in their last meeting that happened recently, so hence we have seen the weak JPY. Currently the pair went up a lot and i am looking into a short term correction.\n\nEntry: 157.753\nTarget: 156.879\n\n\n As always my friends happy trading!\n\nP.S.

        "description": "Hello, this is Greedy All-Day.\nToday's analysis focuses on BNB.\n\nReview of the Previous Analysis\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s start by reviewing the previous analysis.\n\nIn the last analysis, I mentioned that if the red box resistance trendline is broken to the upside, there is a high probability of the price rising to the next supply zone.\nThe price initially faced resistance at the 720 level (first resistance), retraced slightly, but eventually broke through and rose to the upper boundary of the blue box supply zone at 731.\n\nThe resistance occurred at the green box high within the blue box.\nSubsequently, the price failed to break the high, leading to a corrective phase.\n\nBNB Chart from a Buy Perspective\n\n\n\nFrom the daily chart, the resistance trendline has been drawn, extending from previous highs.\n\nFor new buy entries, it would be safer to wait for a breakout above the 738 level (red box).\nCurrently, with Bitcoin in a corrective phase and altcoins also struggling, entering at uncertain levels should be avoided.\nIf the price breaks above 738, a retest of the high\u2014similar to what happened in the yellow box on the left\u2014could occur, with a potential rise at least to the blue box supply zone.\n\nBNB Chart from a Sell Perspective\n\n\n\nSince the bullish candle on December 23, 2024, the price has consistently held above the 678.78 level.\n\nIf the red box is broken to the downside, the price could either create a long lower wick, as seen in the yellow box, or experience a complete fill, resulting in a significant decline.\n\nAdditional Evidence\n\n\n\nThe yellow box and the current high are similar, with a one-way drop previously resulting in a test of the 617 support level.\n\nAs of now, the 617 level, which acted as resistance from June 2024 to November 2024, has turned into support.\nIf the price drops, there\u2019s a possibility of a 10% correction, with a one-way decline toward 617.\n\nConclusion\n\nBNB is currently at a critical juncture. While there are opportunities for both upward and downward moves, waiting for confirmed breakouts or breakdowns will be key to minimizing risk and maximizing profit potential.",

        "name": "\"Don\u2019t Delude Yourself\": Elon Musk's Harsh Advice For TeslaBulls",
        "description": "\"Don\u2019t delude yourself into thinking something\u2019s working when it\u2019s not, or you\u2019re gonna get fixated on a bad solution.\" This stark warning from Elon Musk serves as a poignant reminder not just for his ventures but for investors and enthusiasts following Tesla. The allure of Tesla\u2019s innovative spirit and its groundbreaking promises in self-driving technology and robotics has captured imaginations and driven its stock to impressive highs. However, a critical examination suggests that the company\u2019s current trajectory might not be as promising as the stock prices suggest.\n\nFirstly, Tesla's ambitious Full Self-Driving (FSD) capability continues to be a work in progress, much like the early days of a start-up experimenting in uncharted territories\u2014not the polished product one might expect from a company valued as highly as Tesla. Despite years of development,  Tesla remains significantly behind industry leaders like Waymo  in terms of true autonomous driving technologies. Waymo, with its laser-focused approach on autonomy and years of extensive testing and data, has clearly established a substantial lead.  Betting on Tesla catching up soon is more a gamble than a sound investment strategy. \n\nMoreover, there is a significant cultural and political aspect to consider.  The idea that conservative segments of the market, often characterized stereotypically as rednecks and Republicans, will suddenly pivot and embrace Tesla en masse is far-fetched.  Market penetration into these demographics involves more than just offering a compelling product; it requires aligning with broader lifestyle choices and values, areas where Tesla has not traditionally held sway.\n\nThe optimism surrounding  Tesla's AI robot, Optimus, also requires tempering. In its current form, Optimus is not poised to revolutionize the industry.  Competitors are already showcasing more advanced and practical applications of robotics that overshadow Tesla\u2019s attempts. The robot\u2019s performance has not been encouraging, and banking on it to become a market leader is optimistic at best.\n\nConsidering these elements, Tesla's vision of dominating the robotaxi market appears overly ambitious.  The technological lag, combined with regulatory hurdles and public skepticism, adds layers of uncertainty to this goal.  With predictions like a less than 25% chance of Tesla launching its Cybercab before 2030, the company's future in this arena seems precarious.\n\n Given these factors, it's an opportune moment for savvy investors to reflect on the wisdom of Bill Gates, who is reportedly shorting Tesla stock.  The disparity between Tesla\u2019s market valuation and its actual progress in critical areas suggests that the stock might be poised for a significant correction. Investors might do well to consider whether Tesla, at its current valuation, truly reflects its intrinsic worth or if it is, as Musk warns, a fixation on a \"bad solution.\"\n\nWhile Tesla undoubtedly continues to innovate and push boundaries in many areas, the pragmatic approach would be to prepare for a potential downturn in its stock value, possibly back to around $200. This would more accurately reflect the company's current state in the competitive landscape and its technological advancements, or lack thereof. As always, the key to successful investing is to see through the hype and base decisions on solid, realistic assessments of technology and market trends.",

        "description": "Analyzing the current BTC weekly chart reveals striking similarities to the past, specifically the cycle seen at the end of 2023 and the beginning of 2024. Let\u2019s break it down step by step.\n\n 1. Price Movement Comparison \nLate 2023 vs. Late 2024: At the end of 2023, Bitcoin experienced a sharp rally of around 65%, moving from the lows to a significant peak. Fast forward to late 2024, and we see a nearly identical pattern\u2014again, approximately 65% growth from the bottom to the recent high. The symmetry is hard to ignore.\n 2. WaveFlow Indicator \nOn both occasions, the WaveFlow indicator paints an eerily similar picture. It shows a strong push from the lows to the highs, followed by an expected pullback before another rally. If history repeats itself, the current setup implies that BTC will form a second peak following an intermediate bottom in the near term.\n 3. PrimeMomentum Long-Term Signal \nThe red diamond signal from the PrimeMomentum Long-Term Signal BTC indicator appears in a nearly identical spot:\nThe beginning of 2024: Red diamond signaled a top before a significant correction.\nLate 2024: The same signal has just appeared, aligning with a possible cyclical correction phase.\n 4. PrimeMomentum Oscillator \nAt the bottom of the chart, the PrimeMomentum oscillator shows behavior that mirrors the end of 2023. This resemblance reinforces the idea that Bitcoin\u2019s price action is following a cyclic pattern.\n 5. Expectations and Forecast \nJanuary Correction: Based on these indicators and historical patterns, we anticipate a pullback at the beginning of January 2025, targeting a mid-range consolidation or support zone.\nFebruary\u2013March Rally: Following the correction in the second half of January, a rally is expected, peaking around March 2025, similar to early 2024\u2019s price action.\nPost-March Decline: After March, we could see another downward phase, mirroring the price behavior in mid-2024.\n\n Conclusion: The Power of Cyclicality \nThis chart showcases the undeniable rhythm of Bitcoin\u2019s cyclicality. Indicators like WaveFlow and PrimeMomentum provide clear parallels between the current market state and historical movements. If the cycle repeats as expected:\n\n Short-Term: Prepare for a correction.\nMid-Term: Watch for a strong rally.\nLong-Term: Plan for another cyclical downturn. \nThe data strongly suggests that Bitcoin\u2019s market structure continues to adhere to predictable cyclical trends. With this knowledge, traders can better anticipate key market movements and position themselves accordingly.",

        "description": "GBP/USD Technical Outlook: Bullish Reversal Potential\n\nLooking at the GBP/USD chart, we are seeing a potential bullish reversal forming. After testing the recent support zone around 1.2200, the pair has been showing signs of recovery. Price action indicates that the market might be preparing for an upward move, potentially towards the next key resistance levels.\n\nKey Observations:\n\nSupport Bounce: The pair recently bounced off the strong support area at 1.2200, where multiple previous price reactions suggest a significant zone for buyers.\nBullish Divergence: A noticeable bullish divergence on the RSI signals that momentum could be shifting in favor of the bulls, confirming the potential for a reversal.\nMoving Averages: The 50-period moving average is starting to flatten out, and if price breaks above it, this could further confirm the upward momentum.\nResistance Levels: The next key resistance is near 1.2400, which aligns with the previous swing highs. A breakout above this zone would be a strong signal of continuation towards 1.2500.\nConclusion: Given the recent support and bullish technical signals, I am expecting GBP/USD to make a move higher in the coming days. If the pair can break above 1.2400, we might see a more significant rally. However, a failure to break resistance could lead to further consolidation or even a retest of lower levels.\n\nRisk Management: Always consider proper risk management and wait for clear confirmations before entering any trades.",

Below is an explanation of the potential move to the $90,000\u2013$92,000 region, incorporating technical and fundamental reasoning:\n\nTechnical Analysis\nTrendline Rejection:\nRed arrows indicate multiple rejections at the channel's upper resistance line, suggesting strong selling pressure at higher levels.\nA breakdown from the midline of the channel hints at weakening bullish momentum.\nSupport Zone Target:\nThe projected drop aligns with the lower boundary of the channel near $92,000\u2013$90,000, a likely support area.\nThe price appears to be retesting a minor resistance before continuing the downtrend (gray line indicates the likely path).\nBearish Divergence:\n\nAlthough not visible in this image, momentum indicators like RSI or MACD could confirm bearish divergence at recent highs.\nKey Levels:\nBreakdown of $96,000 would signal increased bearish momentum, accelerating the drop to $90,000.\nFundamental Analysis\nMacro Environment:\nConcerns about interest rate hikes and tightening monetary policies could dampen risk sentiment, affecting Bitcoin negatively.\nAny negative developments in regulatory news or crypto-related insolvencies could accelerate selling pressure.\nLiquidity Considerations:\nEnd-of-year liquidity often diminishes, amplifying volatility and price swings. Traders might also sell to lock in profits or rebalance portfolios.\nMarket Sentiment:\n\nRecent negative news (e.g., potential exchange issues, or lackluster adoption metrics) could weigh on bullish sentiment.\nConversely, fear in traditional markets may lead to risk-off behavior, impacting crypto assets.\nConclusion\nThe combination of technical rejection from key levels and possible negative macroeconomic factors supports a potential bearish move toward $90,000",

The price retraced to Fib 0.786 at $0.03, and started to move up.   Many meme type crypto goes through massive correction and if the project and community is strong, it comes back up strongly.  This chart shows such trend.  The price went up to Fib 0.382, moved back down to Fib 0.618.  As I said in other chart analysis , I like the price to bounce up and down and up and down between key Fib levels.  The price finally went above Fib 0.5 level which is the very first all time high in Dec 2nd and closed above the line.  MACD, Stochastic and RSI all show clear bull signals.  If you are interested in trading, the entry is ideally around 0.08 or below 0.09.  Stop loss is 0.055 and initial profit target 0.122 (because the price often struggles to move beyond Fib 0.236 - final line of defence for bear), but 0.1622 is a good profit target level.  ",

Here's the idea based on this chart:\n\n1. Support Zone:\n\nThe price has tested the support zone near 2,596, showing a strong bounce.\n\nThis indicates potential bullish momentum.\n\n2. Trend Line:\n\nThe chart shows an upward sloping trend line, suggesting that gold is in an uptrend on this timeframe.\n\nThe current pullback seems to have respected the trend line.\n\n3. Resistance Zone:\n\nThe target zone appears to be around 2,630\u20132,634, marked by the green box.\n\n4. Entry and Risk:\n\nA possible entry point would be near 2,602, the current market level.\n\nStop-loss could be set slightly below the support zone at 2,595, as marked.\n\n5. Target:\n\nA potential target is at the resistance zone near 2,633, offering a good risk-to-reward ratio.\n\n\nOverall Idea:\n\nThis chart suggests a buy setup with a short-term bullish target. However, consider key fundamentals (like economic data and USD strength) and adjust for market conditions.\n\n\n",

As you can see here:https://www.tradingview.com/chart/PEPEUSDT/VP77qwjf-PEPEUSDT-Flash-Crash-I-m-Ready/\n\n If you utilized low-time frame market breakdowns, you could have caught some excellent risk-to-reward (RR) opportunities. From the latest blue box.\n\nCurrently, the price seems to be consolidating, and there is an 85% increase in trading volume today, which is significant. Despite my overall bullish outlook, I believe the price may seek lower levels before continuing its upward trajectory. This potential pullback could provide a new and favorable positioning opportunity.\n\nHow to create a position? \n \n When price going down, sometimes CDV goes up, it means an opportunity if general outlook is bullish.\n Sometimes we took a retest from volume profile \"Point of Control\" line and when we reach there we see huge buyers coming in Volume Footprint, it means you can look for an entry.\n \n\nWhen trading the blue box, I will rely on indicators like:\n\nCumulative Delta Volume (CDV)\nLiquidity Heatmap\nVolume Profile\nVolume Footprint\nAdditionally, I will look for upward market structure breaks in lower time frames for confirmation.\nIf you'd like to learn how to utilize CDV, liquidity heatmaps, volume profiles, and volume footprints effectively, feel free to visit my profile and contact me.\n\nBest of luck and manage your risk wisely!\n\n If you think this analysis helps you, please don't forget to boost and comment on this.

        "description": "\ud83c\udf1fHi! Hola! Ola! Bonjour! Hallo!\ud83c\udf1f\nDear Money Makers & Robbers, \ud83e\udd11 \ud83d\udcb0\n\nBased on \ud83d\udd25Thief Trading style technical and fundamental analysis\ud83d\udd25, here is our master plan to heist the AUD/NZD \"Aussie-Kiwi\" Forex market. Please adhere to the strategy I've outlined in the chart, which emphasizes long entry. Our aim is the high-risk Red Zone. Risky level, overbought market, consolidation, trend reversal, trap at the level where traders and bearish robbers are stronger. \ud83d\udc40 So Be Careful, wealthy and safe trade.\ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udfc6\ud83c\udf89\n\nEntry \ud83d\udcc8 : You can enter a Bull trade at any point,\nhowever I advise placing Buy limit orders within a 15 or 30 minute timeframe. Entry from the most recent or closest low or high level should be in retest.\n\nStop Loss \ud83d\uded1: Using the 2H period, the recent / nearest low or high level.\n\nGoal \ud83c\udfaf: 1.11100\n\nScalpers, take note : only scalp on the Long side. If you have a lot of money, you can go straight away; if not, you can join swing traders and carry out the robbery plan. Use trailing SL to safeguard your money \ud83d\udcb0.\n\nBased on the fundamental analysis \ud83d\udcf0, I would conclude that the AUD/NZD (Australian Dollar/New Zealand Dollar) pair is: Bullish\nReasons:\nInterest rate differential: The Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) interest rate (2.85%) is higher than the Reserve Bank of New Zealand's (RBNZ) interest rate (2.50%), making the AUD more attractive to investors.\n\nEconomic growth: Australia's GDP growth (1.7%) is relatively stable, while New Zealand's growth (1.5%) is more dependent on external factors, such as dairy exports.\n\nCommodity prices: Australia's economy is heavily reliant on commodity exports, and a rise in commodity prices could support the AUD.\n\nTrade balance: Australia's trade surplus (AUD 4.8 billion) is larger than New Zealand's trade deficit (NZD 1.1 billion), supporting the AUD.\n\nHowever, it's essential to consider the following risks:\n\nGlobal economic slowdown: A slowdown in global economic growth, particularly in China and the US, could negatively impact the AUD.\n\nDairy prices: A decline in dairy prices could negatively impact New Zealand's economy and support the AUD.\n\nRBNZ's monetary policy: The RBNZ's dovish stance and potential interest rate cuts could support the NZD.\n\nPlease note that this is a general analysis and not personalized investment advice. It's essential to consider your own risk tolerance and market analysis before making any decisions.\n\nWarning\u26a0\ufe0f : Our heist strategy is incompatible with Fundamental Analysis news \ud83d\udcf0 \ud83d\uddde\ufe0f. We'll wreck our plan by smashing the Stop Loss \ud83d\udeab\ud83d\ude8f. Avoid entering the market right after the news release.\n\nTake advantage of the target and get away \ud83c\udfaf Swing Traders Please reserve the half amount of money and watch for the next dynamic level or order block breakout. Once it is resolved, we can go on to the next new target in our heist plan.\n\nKeep in mind that these factors can change rapidly, and it's essential to stay up-to-date with market developments and adjust your analysis accordingly.\n\n\ud83d\udc96Supporting our robbery plan will enable us to effortlessly make and steal money \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb5 Tell your friends, Colleagues and family to follow, like, and share. Boost the strength of our robbery team. Every day in this market make money with ease by using the Thief Trading Style.\ud83c\udfc6\ud83d\udcaa\ud83e\udd1d\u2764\ufe0f\ud83c\udf89\ud83d\ude80\nI'll see you soon with another heist plan, so stay tuned \ud83e\udec2",

        "description": "\nAfter breaking down in the upward range of gold, the hourly line is sideways and bullish and bearish. It successfully broke down for the second time in the US market. The short-term trend returns to the bearish pattern again.\nAfter gold breaks down and adjusts, it falls again in the short term. The price drops to the support of 2605 and then rebounds. The resistance of 2617 above is under pressure. If it breaks up at this position, gold is in a strong rebound stage, and the price may form a horizontal consolidation.\nThe short-term support of 2605 below, if it breaks down here, gold is in a weak adjustment structure. There is a high probability of testing the previous low in the future.\nOn the whole, the short-term trend of gold is dominated by bears in the short term, and it is recommended to rebound and short.\nFocus on the 2615-2617 area above.",

After an anticipated drop to $.91, concurrent with the  CRYPTO:BTCUSD  sell off and rally just now, I believe $ALEO has found a bottom and will reverse direction perhaps permanently. I am now in this position at $.91 precisely and holding for at least a dollar, but will probably continue to hold for $1.32, potential time horizon of two weeks, with I believe a very high likelihood of one week (or less, as a reversal after such a long down trend could attract a lot of attention)\u2026 I think this has potential to go much much higher, but this is a conservative selling point where it will likely see a slowdown anyway\u2026 Longer holding period to be determined upon approach.\n  \n ",

        "name": "HyperLiquid Introduces Native Staking as $HYPE Eyes a 58% Surge",
        "description": "HyperLiquid, a prominent Layer-1 blockchain renowned for its decentralized derivatives exchange, has recently introduced native staking for its  GETTEX:HYPE  token. This move, coupled with promising technical patterns, has set the stage for a potential 58% surge in the token\u2019s value.\n\nThe Staking Overview\nHyperLiquid announced the launch of its native staking on Monday via a post on X (formerly Twitter). Token holders can now stake their  GETTEX:HYPE  tokens across 16 validators, contributing to network security and earning rewards in return. A notable aspect of this staking mechanism is the ability to stake locked tokens bound by a vesting schedule, though accrued rewards remain inaccessible until the lock-up period ends.\n\nAt launch, HyperLiquid staked 300 million tokens, valued at approximately $8.4 billion. Within the first hour, users added another 7 million tokens, reflecting strong community participation. This development comes just a month after the  GETTEX:HYPE  token\u2019s issuance, which debuted at $3.57 and has since soared to $27.89, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nThis remarkable growth has propelled  GETTEX:HYPE  into the top 20 largest tokens by market cap, surpassing well-known assets like Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Litecoin (LTC), and Pepe (PEPE). With a market capitalization of $9.2 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of $2.64 billion, HyperLiquid\u2019s exchange is generating over $1 million in daily revenue, as reported by DefiLlama.\n\nTechnical Outlook\nDespite its fundamental strength,  GETTEX:HYPE  is currently down 2.66%, trading within a symmetrical triangle pattern on the daily chart. This technical formation often signals a potential breakout, though the direction remains uncertain until the price breaches either trendline.\n\nThe relative strength index (RSI) stands at 42, indicating a neutral market sentiment. The upper triangle trendline aligns with the $30 resistance level, making it a critical threshold for bullish momentum. A breakout above $30 could trigger a 50% surge, targeting prices as high as $45. Conversely, a breakdown below the lower triangle trendline could lead to a significant sell-off, with prices potentially dropping by 14%\n\nMarket Implications\nThe introduction of native staking and the token\u2019s rapid rise in market cap underscore HyperLiquid\u2019s growing influence in the blockchain space. The ability to stake locked tokens enhances flexibility for investors, while the platform\u2019s robust trading volume and revenue generation reflect its strong utility.\n\nFor traders, the symmetrical triangle pattern presents a strategic opportunity. Monitoring the $30 resistance level and the lower triangle trendline is crucial for anticipating the token\u2019s next move. A decisive breakout could attract further interest, while a breakdown may signal caution.\n\nConclusion\nHyperLiquid\u2019s latest staking initiative and  GETTEX:HYPE \u2019s impressive market performance highlight the project\u2019s potential as a leading player in the blockchain industry. While the token\u2019s price currently hovers in a consolidation phase, both fundamental and technical indicators suggest that a major move is imminent. Traders and investors should keep a close eye on key levels to capitalize on the next phase of  GETTEX:HYPE \u2019s journey.",

        "description": "Bitcoin is ready for the final crash to around 85k! This is an excellent buying opportunity on the spot market, or you can use leverage on futures. I expect Bitcoin to hit 125k in 2025.\n\n85k is a strong support because it's the start of the FVG (Fair Value GAP). It's the first major point and major support on this chart. Expect a strong rebound from this level. It's possible that Bitcoin will go a little bit lower to 83,842. This is also significant support because it's the 1:1 FIB extension from wave A to wave B. Bitcoin always reacts to this FIB extension; it's the most popular.\n\nAfter we complete the C wave, we are ready to start a new impulse wave and start a new bull market. Also, I expect an altseason to kick in; for example, Ethereum should overpower Bitcoin. The Bitcoin dominance (BTC.D) chart is on a strong resistance.\n\nI think the plan is clear; 2025 will be very successful! Write a comment with your altcoin, and I will make an analysis for you in response. Also, please hit boost and follow for more ideas. Trading is not hard if you have a good coach!

        "description": "\ud83d\udc4b  Welcome to TradeCityPro Channel! \n\nMoney Management Training Is More Important Than Learning Technical Analysis\n\nLet\u2019s start the channel's training with the most important lesson, which helps us survive in the market, transform from a losing trader to a profitable one, and maintain our peace of mind!\n\n\ud83d\udcda  Capital Management in Life \n\nCapital management in life means planning and managing your financial, time, and even energy resources optimally to achieve personal and professional goals. \n\nThis concept goes beyond financial matters and includes conscious and responsible decision-making to utilize various resources.\n\n\ud83d\udd75\ufe0f\u200d\u2642\ufe0f  Capital Management in Financial Markets \n\nCapital management in financial markets refers to planning and controlling the amount of capital allocated for trading, investing, or activities in these markets. \n\nThe main goal of capital management is to reduce the risk of asset loss and maintain financial survival in various market conditions. It is one of the key principles of success in trading and investing.\n\n\ud83d\udcb0  Trading Without Capital Management \n\nSurely, like me, you have traded before learning about capital management, and some of you might have even been profitable for a while. \n\nHowever, that profitability has never been sustainable, and at some point in the market, you would lose a significant portion of your capital. Consequently, you might experience severe stress and pressure, affecting your social relationships, family life, restful sleep, and a stress-free lifestyle.\n\nTrading without capital management can bring profits occasionally, but the volatility in your trading account increases significantly, disrupting your peace of mind. \n\nFor instance, if you have a $10,000 account, trading without capital management might result in one day making $20,000, but the next day dropping to $5,000. This wide range of volatility and the feeling of gaining and losing capital lead to losing your calm in subsequent trades, making you constantly monitor the charts because you haven\u2019t set any rules for yourself.\n\nWhat If My Capital Is Only $100?\nYou might say, \u201cI only have $100; why should I do capital management? A 2% profit on $100 is insignificant.\u201d Here\u2019s the answer: even if your capital is small, you must manage it. \n\nIf you consistently make a 5-10% monthly profit on that $100 over a year, your capital might not become substantial, but you\u2019ll become a trader who many investors will seek to entrust their funds to. So, don\u2019t just look at percentages.\n\n\ud83d\udcb5  Why Don\u2019t Most People Practice Capital Management? \n\nThe reason why 95% of market participants don\u2019t practice capital management is that they see trading as a get-rich-quick scheme. \n\nUnfortunately, due to misleading advertisements designed to empty your pockets, many view trading as a shortcut to wealth. \n\nTrading is a long journey; without practicing capital management, you might turn $100 into $10,000, but you\u2019ll lose it all in the next trade. \n\nThis isn\u2019t poker, gambling, or any similar game. Markets are far more unpredictable. Without setting rules for yourself, you\u2019ll be eliminated quickly, and your money will go to those who stay in the market.\n\n\ud83d\udcbc  Defining Risk in Capital Management and Setting Daily Risk Limits \n\nWhile practicing capital management, you must define your daily risk limit. This means deciding the maximum percentage loss you\u2019re willing to accept before closing the charts and ending your trading day. \n\nFor example, if your daily risk is 1%, regardless of whether you open 4 trades or 2 trades, you\u2019re not allowed to lose more than 1% of your capital in a single day.\n\nNow, suppose you\u2019ve defined your daily risk limit. If you lose 1% for three consecutive days, totaling a 3% capital loss, would you be okay? Would you talk to your family and friends as usual? Would you stay calm? If not, then this isn\u2019t your appropriate risk level, and it needs to be lowered. \n\nAdditionally, you should have a monthly risk limit. For example, if your monthly risk (or drawdown) is 10%, you should stop trading for the month if you lose 10% of your capital and return to the charts the following month.\n\nInitially, accepting stop-losses, planning your trades, and adhering to capital management may be difficult. However, you must practice capital management for all your positions, not just a single trade. \n\nYou should also set penalties for not adhering to it! Penalties vary depending on each person\u2019s life. Moreover, you should view your profits and losses in percentages, not in dollar amounts. For example, instead of saying, \u201cI made $10,\u201d say, \u201cI made a 1% profit.\u201d Viewing your results in percentages is crucial as your capital grows because focusing on dollar amounts can negatively affect your trading.\n\n\ud83d\udca1  Practice and Example on the Chart \n\nLet\u2019s go through an example on the chart to fully grasp the concept. On the chart, you\u2019ll see the capital management formula, which includes:\n\nThe total capital you\u2019re using for futures trading.\nYour risk percentage, which is your position and daily risk discussed earlier. For instance, if your daily risk is 1%, your position risk could be 0.25%, 0.5%, or 1%, depending on the number of trades, but this is specific to the position you\u2019re about to open.\n\nOn the other side of the equation is the position size, which is the unknown we\u2019re solving for using this formula. Next is the leverage, which is set in your exchange and doesn\u2019t significantly impact your capital management. Finally, there\u2019s the stop-loss size, which is determined using the position management tool in TradingView.\n\n\nNow, let\u2019s apply the formula to a Bitcoin trade with a 4% stop-loss and a risk-to-reward ratio of 2.\n\n\nSuppose your total capital for futures is $1,000, and you\u2019re willing to risk 0.5% on this position. The multiplication of these two numbers gives $500. On the other side of the equation, we\u2019re solving for position size in dollars. \n\nAssuming a leverage of 10 and a 4% stop-loss (as shown in the example), the multiplication of 10 and 4 equals 40. Dividing $500 by 40 gives us $12.5. Therefore, you can enter this position with $12.5 using a 10x leverage.\n\n\n\u2764\ufe0f  Friendly Note \n\nIf you don\u2019t practice capital management or don\u2019t agree with me, that\u2019s completely fine! \n\nBut take a small portion of your capital and trade according to the explanation above. See if you feel calmer and more at ease. Afterward, decide what\u2019s best for your life.\n\nFinally, try to share this article as much as possible so that people don't lose their money in the market because it's not just their money that makes them frustrated and their pride is lost. Let's help them with the help of the community!",

        "description": "\ud83d\udc4b Welcome to TradeCityPro!\nIn this analysis, I will examine the APT coin, the primary coin of the APTOS network, which is one of Ethereum's second-layer networks. This analysis will be conducted in the daily timeframe.\n\n\ud83d\udcc5 Daily Timeframe: Breaking the Curved Trend Line and the First Bearish Leg In the daily timeframe, we are witnessing a strong upward trend that started from the $4.89 area with a curved ascending trend line up to $14.75. This trend line supported the price three times but finally broke on the last contact, initiating the start of a bearish wave from this trend line break.\n\n\ud83d\udcca After the price reached the peak of $14.75, the market volume gradually decreased, and after forming a lower high and breaking the curved ascending trend line, the market momentum shifted and the bearish phase began.\n\n\ud83d\udd3d The main correction trigger after the trend line break was the break of $11.28, which coincided with the 0.236 Fibonacci level, making this area a strong Potential Reversal Zone (PRZ). However, the bearish volume and momentum were strong enough to break this support.\n\n\ud83d\udd0d Currently, the price is attempting to round off and form a bottom. It's also the Christmas holiday season, and the market volume has decreased, which could make it easier for whales and holders of this coin to facilitate bottom formation. Additionally, the price has reached the golden Fibonacci zone between 0.5 and 0.618, which could significantly influence the end of the correction and the continuation of the upward trend.\n\n\ud83e\udde9 The RSI oscillator is also in a critical and interesting area. If it stabilizes below 30 and enters the Oversell region, there might be panic in the market, potentially leading to a sharp drop. For the continuation of the upward trend and a new bullish leg, the RSI needs to rise above the 50 area to introduce momentum into the market.\n\n\ud83d\udcc9 If further correction occurs, the next support level is at $7.51, and in the event of panic and sharp declines, the next support would be at $4.89.\n\n\ud83d\udd3c For long positions, if the momentum changes, the market will create a new structure and provide triggers, but currently, the only triggers are at $11.28 and $14.75. The next resistance will be at $17.96.\n\n\ud83d\udcdd Final Thoughts\n\nThis analysis reflects our opinions and is not financial advice.\n\nShare your thoughts in the comments, and don\u2019t forget to share this analysis with your friends! \u2764\ufe0f",

        "description": "The best possible scenario for the Altcoins market is developing right now as Bitcoin starts to produce a short-term bullish reversal. We are seeing the 0.786 Fib. retracement level being conquered as resistance, reclaimed as support. The recent drop can easily end as a fail breakout down based on the 4H timeframe with a close in 1 hour above $93,771. This would confirm a higher low vs 5-Dec. and open the doors for the upper resistance of the sideways trading range to be tested next. This can be $99,000 or even $104,000 or up to $108,000.\n\nHere why it is unwise to be short at this point. This bullish reversal and soon challenge of resistance can transform into the resumption of the bullish move, it can even end as a higher high even if a shy one; impossible to know. What we do know is that the market is bullish and when the market is bullish all positions should be with the market trend and not against. All positions should be focused on the upside/LONG. When there is a drop, this becomes an opportunity to buy. This is what we see on this chart.\n\nThis is an interesting development and can lead to higher prices next. Higher prices at this point, at this juncture on this date, can mean awesome Altcoins growth. I mention the Altcoins because Bitcoin is consolidating, sideways, when Bitcoin is sideways within a bullish market the Altcoins grow.\n\nWhen Bitcoin grows 10%, some Altcoins can grow 80% or more.\nWhen Bitcoin grows 40%, some Altcoins can be up 300% or more.\n\nBitcoin is for the whales, the Altcoins are for us.\n\nThis is a short-term analysis. Confirmation is needed. All the levels are clearly depicted on the chart. Above the highlighted support levels we are super bullish. Bullish after 13 days of down can really make a difference now. You will feel it. Feeling the bullish pressure for such a minor development only reveals the true sentiment of the market. The majority knows. Crypto is bullish and the world knows. Crypto is going up. Bitcoin is going up. The Altcoins are going up.\n\nThat's awesome.\nDo you agree?\n\nThanks a lot for your continued support.\n\nNamaste.",

        "description": "Based on the chart I created, here\u2019s my analysis and the potential next steps for the  Celestia (TIA/USDT)  pair:\n\n1.  Support Area:   \n   I\u2019ve identified a strong support zone around  4.370 - 4.653 USDT . This area looks promising for a  BUY  opportunity, as support levels often act as key reversal points where price tends to bounce back.\n\n2.  Potential Price Movement:   \n   The Take Profit level is set at  4.950 USDT , offering a potential gain of approximately  8.45%  from the lower bound of the support area. If the price respects this support zone, it\u2019s likely to move toward this target.\n\n3.  Trading Strategy :   \n   -  Buy Zone :  I plan to enter a position near or within the support range (4.370 - 4.653 USDT) while monitoring volume and looking for bullish candlestick confirmations.  \n   -  Stop Loss:  To manage risks, I\u2019ll set a stop loss slightly below the support level, around 4.300 USDT, to protect against potential breakdowns.  \n   -  Take Profit:  My target is at 4.950 USDT, aligning with the nearest resistance level.\n\n4.  Additional Considerations:  \n   - If the price breaks above 4.950 USDT, there could be additional upside potential, so I\u2019ll keep an eye on market sentiment and trading volume for confirmation.  \n   - However, if the price falls below the support zone, I\u2019ll hold off on taking further action until a new setup or support level emerges.\n\nThis plan is based on the current technical structure of the chart. I\u2019ll also stay updated on any news or developments related to Celestia (TIA), as they could significantly influence the price movement.",

Let\u2019s analyze this critical setup of #Stellar:\n\n\ud83d\udc8e#XLM has been forming a classic falling wedge pattern on the 8-hour chart, a formation known for its bullish breakout potential. Price is currently testing the descending resistance, and this is where things could get exciting. A clean breakout above this resistance would signal a major shift in momentum and open the door for a significant move higher.\n\n\ud83d\udc8eWhen #XLMUSD clears the descending resistance of the falling wedge, the immediate resistance lies at the $0.45 level. This critical level needs to be cleared for  CRYPTOCAP:XLM  to confirm its bullish breakout. If bulls succeed, the next target lies in the major resistance zone near 0.6500, representing a potential 40%+ upside. Look for strong volume and convincing bullish candles above the resistance to confirm market conviction. Without these signals, any upward movement could turn out to be a fakeout.\n\n\ud83d\udc8eHowever, if #XLM fails to clear the descending resistance then it might come to retest the support zone at $0.32. Buyers have held this level and the probability of jumping here is quite high. But if this level also doesn't hold, there will be a retest of the demand zone at $0.24. \n\n\ud83d\udc8eHowever, a daily close below $0.24 would invalidate the bullish setup and potentially lead to a sharper drop toward 0.2000 or lower. \n\nStay focused, patient, and disciplined, Paradisers\ud83e\udd42\n\nMyCryptoParadise\niFeel the success\ud83c\udf34",

        "description": "\ud83d\udc4b  Welcome to TradeCityPro Channel! \nWelcome to the last analysis of 2024! The Trade City Pro team is very happy to have been with you this year and, at your request, has resumed its activity on TradingView. Our first analysis dates back to 2021 on this platform. :)\n\n\ud83c\udf10  Overview Bitcoin \n\nNow let\u2019s analyze Bitcoin Cash (BCH) together in the final hours of this year. But remember, tomorrow is the most holiday-packed day of the year, with about 60% of the world\u2019s population enjoying their break, which means trading activity is expected to be low.\n\nBefore starting the analysis, as always, let\u2019s take a quick look at Bitcoin. On the 1-hour timeframe, it has rejected resistance, and the RSI failed to enter overbought territory, returning to the 91830\u201395753 box. It\u2019s likely that Bitcoin will range within this box tomorrow.\n\nAlongside this rejection, Bitcoin dominance has been trending upwards, causing altcoins to experience deeper red candles on the last day of the year.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcca  Weekly Timeframe \n\nOn the weekly timeframe, BCH is one of those coins that is still bullish. It recorded higher lows in both 2023 and 2024 and has shown good performance. The $94.8\u2013$138.2 range corresponds to Bitcoin\u2019s $16k zone.\n\nIf you bought from lower levels, it\u2019s reasonable not to make any moves for now and continue holding your position. You can consider withdrawing your initial capital and exiting below $302.4 if a weekly candle closes there.\n\nPersonally, I\u2019m not entering this coin right now, but the $689.5 trigger on the weekly timeframe is a key level. After breaking this, BCH is likely to enter the overbought zone with higher volume. Therefore, taking risks and buying at $302.4 or $424.2 could be logical.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcc8  Daily Timeframe \n\nOn the daily timeframe, after breaking through the daily resistance box at $369.8, which gradually lowered its resistance, BCH started its upward move and was rejected at $623.4, leading to the key support level of $432.0.\n\nThis support is very important as it can change the corrective momentum and enable BCH to test the highs again. If it breaks, BCH could drop to $369.8.\n\nDuring the uptrend and box breakout, volume increased, which is a good sign. However, volume decreased during the decline, which is also positive. Still, today\u2019s daily candle shows significant volume with an upper shadow, increasing the likelihood of further downside.\n\n\n\u23f1  4-Hour Timeframe \n\nOn the 4-hour timeframe, we see that volume is at its lowest, and trading activity is minimal. If you\u2019re trading, open positions with lower risk.\n\nAt the $622.1 level, a fake breakout occurred. This is a trader-trapping strategy where, after faking a support or resistance, we look for the first breakout trigger on lower timeframes and open a risky position, as fake breakouts can sometimes reverse trends.\n\n\ud83d\udcc8  Long Position Trigger \nsince BCH is at a relatively higher level than most altcoins, we can open one after breaking $453.6, but with a small stop-loss and quick profit-taking.\n\n\ud83d\udcc9  Short Position Trigger \nBCH is at critical support, and after breaking $431.2, there\u2019s no significant support until $383.3, making it possible to open a short position. Just remember that market volume is very low, so trade with reduced risk and exit promptly when necessary. I\u2019ll indicate whether to use a larger stop-loss like last month\u2019s uptrend or not when it\u2019s required.\n\n\ud83d\udcdd  Final Thoughts \n\nStay calm, trade wisely, and let's capture the market's best opportunities!\n\nThis analysis reflects our opinions and is not financial advice.\n\nShare your thoughts in the comments, and don\u2019t forget to share this analysis with your friends! \u2764\ufe0f",

        "description": "\ud83d\udc4b Welcome to TradeCityPro!\nIn this analysis, I will examine the ONG coin, a key project within the Ontology ecosystem and a foundation for other projects within this ecosystem.\n\n\ud83d\udcc5 Daily Timeframe: Loss of Momentum After a 100% Rally \nIn the daily timeframe, we observe an accumulation box from $0.2504 to $0.3551. After the last rebound from the $0.2504 support, the price experienced a 100% growth to the resistance at $0.5392.\n\n\ud83d\udd3d After reaching this area, the market momentum completely shifted, and the price fell first to $0.3551 and is now at $0.3002. We can now say that the bullish momentum has dissipated, and for the price to increase again, it needs to build a new structure.\n\n\ud83d\udd0d If further declines occur, breaking $0.3002 would be a suitable trigger. For confirmation of bullish trends, breaking $0.3551 is appropriate, but I will discuss these triggers more in the 4-hour analysis.\n\n\ud83d\udcca The volume for this coin is generally low, which, as you can see, creates many shadows making futures trading challenging. Currently, the volume is also gradually decreasing.\n\n\ud83d\udd3c If $0.3551 breaks and the RSI surpasses 50, the price could move higher. The targets for this move are $0.5392 and $0.7393.\n\n\ud83d\udcc9 If $0.3002 breaks, the next supports are $0.2504 and $0.2170.\n\n\n\n\u23f34-Hour Timeframe: Futures Triggers \nIn the 4-hour timeframe, we can see price behavior in more detail.\n\n\u2728 After the second bearish leg from $0.4071 to $0.3002 and a fake break of this support, the price formed a range box and we can also observe a descending trend line.\n\n\ud83d\udd3d For a short position, if $0.3002 breaks, consider opening a short position. The target for this position is $0.2602. However, a floor above this zone at $0.3100 presents a riskier trigger, and if this area breaks, you could open an early short position. A break of 41.06 aids the entry of more bearish momentum and further market decline.\n\n\ud83d\udcc8 For a long position, first wait for the descending trend line to break. In this case, you can use the trend break trigger or wait for a break of $0.3564. The target for this movement is $0.4071. The next trigger for a long position is a fake break of the $0.3002 support, which has already happened once and managed to keep the price above it. In case of another fake break, you could open a position with an engulfing candle or another pattern trigger.\n\n\ud83d\udcdd Final Thoughts\n\nThis analysis reflects our opinions and is not financial advice.\n\nShare your thoughts in the comments, and don\u2019t forget to share this analysis with your friends! \u2764\ufe0f",

        "description": "Very bearish content is now circulating here, YouTube Twitter etc\n\nSo my technical perspective is currently in the bullish end of the spectrum except for crypto fanboys that always post bullish.\n\nBut there is significant danger because both Nasdaq + S&P + Dow Jones and TOTAL have hit significant long term 1.618 ratios.\n\nTOTAL:\n\n\nNasdaq Futures:\n\n\nS&P Futures:\n\n\nDow Jones Futures:\n\n\nOn BTC chart, the 1:0.618 Golden Window should be the most likely reversal ratio in this area because that would show strength in the overall trend.\n\nAnd there will be high liquidity below support @$91.2K.\n\nThat said there will also be higher liquidity below support @ $85K.\n\nBut that lower support is far less defined and whipsaw is the market maker thumbprint.\n\nSignificant reversals are more likely just beyond price points that have previously seen high volatility whipsaw.\n\nAnd so the most likely reversal point in terms of ratio and liquidity is below support and down  into the Golden Window ($90.4K - 88K).\n\nBut if stock indexes collapse then that can be the cause to pull Bitcoin down further.\n\nIts certainly complex.\n\nBut in the end Bitcoin will see $174K \ud83e\uddd0.\n\nThis will be my last content of the year. \n\nHave a great NYE \ud83c\udf86\n\n Not advice",
