        "description": "Trendlines\nThe white lines are the markers of order amidst chaos. Solid and dashed, they connect critical highs and lows, serving as pathways that reveal the future of price action. They outline the potential for breakouts or breakdowns\u2014decision points where the market bows to our strategy. \nThese lines carve the battlefield, where traders either rise or fall. These highs and lows are structured almost uniquely, deviating from the conventional setup of ordinary highs and lows.\n\nVolume Weighted Average Price (VWAP)\nThe blue stair-step line is no ordinary indicator\u2014it is the foundation of fair value. This VWAP dynamically calculates the average price weighted by volume, serving as a stronghold for price action. The market respects it as a key support and resistance level. A bounce off this VWAP is a signal of bullish resurgence, while a break below hints at bearish momentum. It\u2019s not just a line\u2014it\u2019s the axis around which the market pivots.\n\nIndicator\nThis is the pinnacle of liquidity visualization. The lines below are not mere decorations\u2014they are the heartbeat of the market:\n\u2022\tOrange (Bitcoin Price): The core driver of the current movement.\n\u2022\tYellow (BTC.D Moving Average): The critical indicator of Bitcoin dominance. When BTC.D rises, Bitcoin often gains strength at the expense of altcoins. When BTC.D falls, altcoin liquidity flows upward.\n\u2022\tBlue (TOTAL3 Moving Average): The maestro of altcoins, showcasing their potential for explosive growth.\nThis tool mirrors liquidity flows, signaling shifts in dominance. As Bitcoin moves downward, we see Bitcoin price rise; when Bitcoin moves upward, Bitcoin price moves downwards. This interplay reveals the unseen mechanics of the market.\n\nVolume Profile (Left Sidebar)\nThe red and green histogram bars are the battlegrounds of buyers and sellers:\n\u2022\tRed bars: High selling activity, barriers the bulls must conquer.\n\u2022\tGreen bars: Strongholds of buying strength, where the bulls rally their forces.\nAs of now, the price dances near high-volume nodes\u2014key zones of contention. Victory lies in breaking free from these areas, unleashing powerful directional moves.\n\nCustom Candles\nThese candles are the secretive arsenal of this strategy, meticulously designed to expose manipulation, price inconsistencies, and pivotal moments in the market. They are crafted to reveal when the market is preparing for massive moves while remaining subtle in their true power. They keep the edge sharp without revealing too much.\n\nAltcoin and Bitcoin Insights\nThis is a live battlefield where updates reign supreme. Altcoins are testing their waters, and Bitcoin pumps are set to reignite soon. I will be providing updates for short trades as manipulation keeps unfolding and inconsistencies present themselves.\n\nNote: The VWAP has been condensed into a 5-day timeframe to align seamlessly with the chart, while the indicator operates on a 1-day timeframe. Additionally, it dynamically reflects insights from the 4-hour timeframe, offering a multi-dimensional view of price action. \n\n(Global liquidity is where prices are headed) \n",
